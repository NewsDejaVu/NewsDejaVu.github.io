# Disclaimer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large language model is used to select a historical news article that is similar in its use of language to a modern news article, after names of people, locations, and organizations have been masked. The language model captures similarities in the semantics of how things are described, which may or may not reflect similarities in the underlying events or situations being described. While the historical news articles are drawn from mainstream news wires, they reflect the norms and biases of their time and may be considered offensive or contain inaccurate information.
