Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight While the conflict is unlikely to lead to the severing of diplomatic relations, it has scrambled the calculations of emergent gulf powers that see in Israel a potential security partner and a counterweight to regional rival Iran. Now, leaders must grapple with an outpouring of public anger over a war that has killed more than 13,300 Palestinians and left much of the Gaza Strip in ruins.\n\nIn speeches, statements and social media posts, gulf leaders have condemned the death and destruction in Gaza, but they have also been careful to stress the importance of regional stability and lines of communication. Qatar, the country most diplomatically engaged in the crisis, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel but has succeeded in mediating a temporary pause in the fighting \u2014 allowing for the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe United States has championed Arab normalization with Israel across two administrations. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain formalized ties with Israel in 2020 under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, followed by Morocco and Sudan. Washington had hoped that Saudi Arabia \u2014 the gulf\u2019s dominant power \u2014 would be next. Now, those plans are on hold.\n\n\u201cI cannot prove what I\u2019m about to say,\u201d President Biden said earlier this month. \u201cBut I believe one of the reasons why Hamas struck when they did was they knew that I was working very closely with the Saudis and others in the region to bring peace to the region by having recognition of Israel and Israel\u2019s right to exist.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia has called for a comprehensive cease-fire in Gaza, describing the war as a \u201cdangerous development\u201d and a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe.\u201d At home, the kingdom has taken steps to channel public expressions of solidarity with Palestinians into relief and fundraising efforts.\n\nSpeaking on Nov. 18 at the IISS Manama Dialogue in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former ambassador to Washington and senior member of the royal family, said the crisis in Gaza has shown that regional peace efforts that fail to address the occupation of Palestinian land are an \u201cillusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis war is a turning point in the process of a serious search for a just solution to the Palestinian issue,\u201d he said. Moving forward, any effort must address \u201cthe legitimate demand of the Palestinians for self-determination.\u201d\n\nThe UAE and Bahrain have defended their ties with Israel, saying it allows them to act as a moderating force in the crisis.\n\nAnwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the president of the UAE, said his country has leverage with Israel that otherwise would not exist. He said they have used their influence so far to push for humanitarian relief, \u201cbut this leverage will also grow at some stage.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if anything would compel the UAE to break ties with Israel, Gargash was circumspect: \u201cWhat we have found through our diplomatic process is that instant gratification is not the solution in politics. Communication is the solution in politics.\u201d\n\nBut on social media, at protests and in dinner table conversations, many gulf citizens say they want their leaders to do more.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any benefit. We should pressure Israel. That is how you end apartheid, with boycott,\u201d said a 45-year old pharmacist who attended an anti-normalization protest recently with her sister and infant niece in Manama, the capital of Bahrain. She, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss politically sensitive subjects.\n\n\u201cWith normalization, what you are saying is that what\u2019s happening to the Palestinian people is normal,\u201d she said. The woman, whose family is Palestinian, said she doesn\u2019t believe that diplomatic ties with Israel have helped the region.\n\n\u201cIf we had stability, you wouldn\u2019t have what\u2019s happening in Gaza. The instability was always there. Now it\u2019s just out in the open for everyone to see.\u201d\n\nAs public anger grows, Israeli businesses in the gulf have adopted lower public profiles. They are sitting out trade shows, pulling advertising and downsizing official delegations.\n\n\u201cBeneath the surface, it\u2019s business as usual. We just advertise the relationship less,\u201d said one businessman in the gulf who works extensively with Israeli companies.\n\n\u201cThe business relationship was there before [the Abraham Accords], and it will be there after this blows over,\u201d he said.\n\nBut consumers are speaking with their wallets. A grass-roots boycott movement against Western brands, including Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s, has gained support in the gulf and across the Arab world.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nA 30-year-old Kuwaiti social media consultant who has spent her whole life in Dubai described the relationship with Israeli businesses in the UAE as \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d She said she used to meet regularly with representatives from Israeli brands but has taken a step back since the war began. She doubts things will ever return to how they were before Oct. 7, when Hamas militants killed at least 1,200 people across southern Israel.\n\nWhile, on the surface, life in the UAE appears to go on as normal, the woman said the war was all-consuming. It dominates conversations with friends and family. \u201cEveryone is just feeling numb,\u201d she said. Like thousands of others, she joined a government-organized aid drive in Dubai.\n\n\u201cI wanted to have an outlet to feel like I am making a difference, even if it\u2019s trivial,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the best I can do. Your hands are tied, so you\u2019re going to do whatever you can do within your resources.\u201d\n\nHowever widespread the feelings of helplessness and frustration here, she said they haven\u2019t translated into anti-government sentiment.\n\n\u201cSome people hope the UAE would have a stronger stance, but at the end of the day they trust the government because there is information that we don\u2019t know about,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know they prioritize security and stability because look at the track record.\u201d\n\nIn Bahrain, the anger feels more raw, and potentially more worrying for authorities.\n\nA few miles from the five-star hotel hosting the security summit in Manama, hundreds of people marched against normalization, chanting \u201cFrom Ramallah to Bahrain, we are one nation, not two\u201d and \u201cNo to displacement, no to normalization, long live Palestine!\u201d\n\nThe march was granted a protest permit by Bahrain\u2019s government \u2014 an acknowledgment, attendees said, that public discontent is now an undeniable political force.\n\nBahrain\u2019s Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa cautioned against actions that undermine \u201cthe rules-based order\u201d in his speech marking the opening of the summit. He said countries such as his must work \u201cwith all of the parties involved to make sure that our voice\u201d is heard. The longer the war in Gaza lasts, he cautioned, the more likely it will lead to instability and extremism.\n\nNearby, in a neighborhood dotted with sleek restaurants and cafes, dozens of people gathered recently outside the office of a Palestinian advocacy group, calling on the government to break ties with Israel.\n\nA 33-year-old Bahraini man, who works as a private art curator and described himself as a government supporter, admitted he was never comfortable with his country\u2019s decision to normalize relations with Israel. Now, after seeing the brutality of the war in Gaza, he hopes that authorities will reverse course.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a society\u2019s values are ever perfectly reflected by its leadership, but on this I hope it changes. I hope they cut ties,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Shiite parts of this Sunni-ruled kingdom, where resentment has long simmered, the war in Gaza is fueling more overt fury.\n\nOutside a Shiite mosque in the north, following Friday prayers, dozens of men, women and children gathered, holding signs calling for Israel to be erased and accusing American leaders of genocide.\n\n\u201cWe are a small voice, but an important voice,\u201d said a 35-year-old travel agent on the edge of the gathering.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/29/gulf-gaza-israel-uae-bahrain/", "nearest_hist_news": [{"image_file_name": "302396269-madison-wisconsin-state-journal-Aug-10-1988-p-1.jpg", "headline": "UN duns for gulf force\n", "article": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) \u2014 The financially\nstrapped United Nations created a $74-million\nobserver corps Tuesday to monitor a truce be-\ntween Iran and Iraq, but the secretary-general\nsaid, \u201cI simply do not have the money\u201d to pay\nfor it.\n\nMarrack Goulding, undersecretary-general\nin charge of peacekeeping operations, said the\nGeneral Assembly probably would be sum-\nmoned to a special session this week to assess\nfunds from the membership.\n\nSecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar\ntold an American reporter: \u201cYou should advise\nyour government to participate fully in these ef-\nforts for peace.\u201d\n\nThe United States, which supports UN\npeacemaking in the Persian Gulf and Afghani-\nstan, has fallen $467 million behind in its UN\npayments over several years.

More than four-fifths of this positive jump was attributable to a drop in covid-19 deaths.\n\nBut the rebound in 2022, which the CDC had anticipated after studying death rates, regained less than half the years lost to the pandemic, the federal health agency reported.\n\n\u201cThe amount of recovery is not as much as we\u2019d like to see,\u201d Steven Woolf, director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University, said after reviewing the report.\n\nHe said many peer countries suffered smaller drops in life expectancy and rebounded more quickly from covid-19\u2019s impact.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disturbing but not surprising to me that we have not experienced the recovery that other countries have,\u201d Woolf said.\n\nIn 2019, U.S. life expectancy at birth stood at 78.8 years. That figure cratered to 76.4 in 2021, the lowest since 1996. That was due partly to the extraordinary wave of covid deaths in January and February of that year as the United States had only begun to roll out vaccines. The following winter saw another short but intense wave of deaths as the omicron variant of the virus reached the country, creating the last major surge in pandemic deaths.\n\n\u201cThere appears to have been some recovery from covid, but we still have a way to go,\u201d said William Schaffner, an infectious-disease physician at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cCovid remains with us and continues to put people in the hospital, and have a substantial mortality rate associated with it, particularly among older people and people who are immunocompromised,\u201d Schaffner said.\n\nThe rise in certain chronic diseases in the United States \u2014 and slower progress in combating others \u2014 put the nation in a vulnerable position when the novel virus arrived. A scattered and politically polarized response to the pandemic played a role in the dire death toll that followed, as did resistance to vaccination and other public health measures. No other wealthy country experienced so high a rate of death per capita from covid.\n\nThe new numbers are clearly positive \u2014 compared with 2021. But the same data show the dramatic, and protracted, impact of the pandemic. Between 2019 and 2021, life expectancy dropped 2.4 years, and the 2022 jump restored only 1.1. years of that deficit. (Men lost 2.8 years in those first two years, and women 2.1 years.)\n\nThe United States has dug itself into a huge life-expectancy hole, and not just because of the virus that slipped into the country in stealth fashion in 2020. In articles this year, The Washington Post has explored the many reasons this country lags peer nations in life expectancy, and a major finding is that chronic conditions such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes and cancer play an underappreciated role in suppressing life spans.\n\nThe new report affirms that conclusion. Although the coming and going of covid explains much of the shape of the mortality curve during the past several years, the CDC death data from the past decade and a half shows an ominous long-term trend in mortality that is not solely due to the coronavirus or other high-profile killers, including drug overdoses and gun homicides.\n\nLife expectancy rose in a relatively steady fashion for all of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st. But starting in 2010, the country entered a decade of stagnation in this key metric. Drug overdoses, homicides and suicides played major roles in flattening the life expectancy curve. But the greatest erosion in life spans comes from chronic illnesses, The Post found in its analysis of death data.\n\nLife expectancy peaked at 78.9 in 2014, and then dipped or remained flat through 2019. The new CDC data, despite showing an improvement in 2022, suggests that this period of disappointing life expectancy will continue.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\u201cThe pattern is consistent with the stagnation that we\u2019ve seen since 2010,\u201d said Elizabeth Arias, a demographer with the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics and lead author of the new report.\n\n\u201cEven without the pandemic, life expectancy was flat or declining,\u201d Arias said. \u201cThis is a whole new territory that we\u2019re in, beginning a decade ago.\u201d\n\nVery few countries have yet published life expectancy data for 2022, as reflected in records at the international human mortality database. The few that have, however, all show quicker recovery from the pandemic.\n\nSweden in 2022 was back to the same life expectancy as before covid, 83.1 years, more than 5\u00bd years longer than in the United States.\n\nIn 2022, Belgium, Denmark and Norway had just slightly lower life expectancy than before the pandemic.\n\nAmong countries reporting data for 2022, Finland comes closest to the profile of the United States in terms of recovery from the devastation wrought by the pandemic. In Finland, life expectancy was down 0.6 years compared with 2019. But that loss is less than half of the U.S. decrease of 1.3 years since 2019.\n\nLife expectancy at birth is not a prediction for any individual, but a statistical artifact, one that aggregates death rates from many different age cohorts and creates a handy, if potentially confusing, measure of a nation\u2019s overall health.\n\nSchaffner, the Vanderbilt doctor, said the lingering effects of the pandemic and other health challenges provide a reminder that the United States needs to continue its comprehensive childhood vaccination program, which typically requires children to be immunized before attending school.\n\n\u201cAnd now we have a slow erosion of that, with increasing vaccine skepticism and more and more parents withholding their children from comprehensive vaccination,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to erode these very successful preventive health initiatives.\u201d\n\nThe new CDC report, which is considered \u201cprovisional\u201d in advance of a final report due in December, captures the racial and ethnic disparities in life expectancy that were exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nAll race and ethnicity groups in the country have lower life expectancy as of 2022 than before the pandemic. Native Americans suffered the largest overall decline, almost four years, to less than 68 years. Black people suffered the second-largest life-expectancy setback, of two years.

The median age\nmeans that half the people in the\ncountry are older than that and half\nare younger.\n\nThe death rate of those between the\nages of 45 and 54 dropped six times\nfaster between 1973 and 1975 than It\ndid in the previous 13 years, And the\ndeath rate of those between 65 and 74\ndropped more than four times as fast.\n\nSpecifically, 6.5 out of every 1,000\npeople between the ages of 45 and 54\ndied in 1975.

Choose your plan ArrowRight In Bethlehem, Christmas is canceled. Palestinian Christian leaders across denominations in the West Bank city decided last week that they will forgo all festivities this year as a mark of solidarity with their brethren in Gaza. There will be no public celebrations, no twinkling Christmas lights and no decorated tree in Manger Square \u2014 not as long, they say, as a state of war reigns over the embattled Gaza Strip, and the majority of its residents cope with Israeli bombardments, the devastation of their homes and a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\n\n\u201cThis is madness,\u201d Munther Isaac, pastor of Bethlehem\u2019s Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church, told me. \u201cThis has become a genocide with 1.7 million people displaced.\u201d\n\nIsaac was part of a small delegation of Palestinian Christians who came to Washington this week to lobby the Biden administration, U.S. lawmakers and religious leaders to support calls for a full-scale cease-fire. A six-day pause in hostilities between Israel and militant group Hamas is set to elapse Thursday, though negotiations with Hamas involving U.S., Israeli and Arab officials are ongoing to potentially extend the current truce. Israeli officials have vowed to continue their campaign against Hamas after hostages are released, while the Biden administration appears to be trying to restrain whatever next phase of the war Israel chooses to launch.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the delegation went to the White House and delivered a letter for President Biden signed by the leaders of the Christian community in Bethlehem, including Isaac\u2019s Protestant denomination and his Orthodox, Armenian and Catholic counterparts. They also went to the Hill to meet staff in the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cGod has placed political leaders in a position of power so that they can bring justice, support those who suffer, and be instruments of God\u2019s peace,\u201d reads the letter, which I got to see in advance of its delivery. \u201cWe want a constant and comprehensive cease-fire. Enough death. Enough destruction. This is a moral obligation. There must be other ways. This is our call and prayer this Christmas.\u201d\n\nIn footage geolocated by The Washington Post, people searched through rubble after the Church of St. Porphyrius in Gaza City was struck Oct. 20. (Video: X)\n\nPalestinian Christians belong to the world\u2019s oldest Christian communities, rooted in the historic cradle of Christianity. But they are diminished in number, at least in proportion to their neighbors of other faiths, and are represented in greater strength in the Palestinian diaspora around the world. Palestinian Christians comprise some 2 percent of the overall Palestinian population in the West Bank, concentrated mostly around Ramallah, Bethlehem and Jerusalem, and less than 1 percent of the population in Gaza.\n\nThe latter community, small but prominent, is in the midst of a potential extinction event. There are roughly fewer than 1,000 Christians in Gaza, who have lived there without much problem despite the de facto takeover of the territory in 2007 by Hamas. But Israeli airstrikes destroyed or damaged almost all the community\u2019s homes in Gaza City while also hitting Gaza\u2019s oldest active church, where some were sheltering. \u201cThe vast majority of the Christian community in Gaza are now homeless,\u201d Isaac said.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThat\u2019s prompted perhaps as much as a fifth of Gaza\u2019s Christians who also had foreign passports to abandon the territory altogether. The rest find themselves forsaken. \u201cThey are calling to us, saying, \u2018Let us leave, we either die or we leave,\u2019\u201d said Tamar Haddad, a regional coordinator of the Lutheran World Federation who was also part of the visiting delegation.\n\nJack Sara, president of Bethlehem Bible College, pointed to how the plight of Palestinian Christians doesn\u2019t seem to be heard by many U.S. evangelicals, who see in muscular Jewish supremacy over the Holy Land a pathway for their own messianic vision. Tennessee-based evangelical preacher Greg Locke, a vocal and oft-viral pro-Trump clergyman, called for Israel to reduce Gaza to a \u201cparking lot\u201d not long after the Oct. 7 attack. More than 13,000 Palestinians have been killed in the weeks since, including thousands of children.\n\nThe ideology of Christian Zionism animated the agenda of the Trump administration and influences a vast segment of Republican lawmakers, from former vice president Mike Pence to current Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.). Sara, a leading Palestinian evangelical theologian, told me that their creed \u201cis not the evangelical theology and its message of love of all humans, regardless of their background and ethnicity\u201d in which he believes and practices.\n\nAway from Gaza, the members of the delegation described a growing climate of intimidation and hostility toward Palestinian Christians in the West Bank and Jerusalem, fueled by the actions of Jewish extremists emboldened by Israel\u2019s far-right government. \u201cWe feel Jewish extreme radicals want us out of Jerusalem and they\u2019re working on it and they\u2019re going unchecked,\u201d Isaac said.\n\nThe delegation\u2019s members condemned Hamas\u2019s actions and deplored its killing of innocent civilians and abduction of hostages. But they questioned Israel\u2019s declared intention to wipe out an organization that is part of the fabric of Palestinian society and seen as a standard-bearer of resistance to decades of Israeli military occupation and domination. \u201cAs horrifying as October 7 was, things did not start there,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cAnd you cannot just begin the story from there and as such, give a green light for Israel to do what it\u2019s doing right now, which goes way beyond, which is a revenge campaign.\u201d\n\nMany leading foreign diplomats have stressed the underlying importance of reviving the long-stalled and moribund process of the two-state solution. Most Palestinians are cynical about this project, given the fecklessness of their own political leadership and the West\u2019s inability to prevent Israel from further carving up the West Bank with settlements over the past two decades. Many Israeli politicians, including leading members of the current government, are also explicitly opposed to the creation of an independent Palestinian state.\n\nBut any postwar dispensation will have to reckon with the ground realities in Israel and the occupied territories. \u201cOne thing is clear: all my interlocutors in the Arab world have accepted Israel\u2019s existence and want to engage with it,\u201d wrote top E.U. diplomat Josep Borrell in a Financial Times op-ed that followed a recent trip to the Middle East. \u201cThey recognize the immense opportunity that lies in a peaceful neighborhood, cross-border cooperation and Israel\u2019s potential role as a regional economic driver. But all agree that Arab-Israeli cooperation hinges upon resolving the Palestinian question.\u201d\n\nIn recent statements, President Biden has also invoked the need to forge a two-state solution as a priority for the region. But talk is cheap. \u201cAmerica needs to prove to the Palestinians that they are serious about the two state solution because any talk from the Americans about a two-state solution right now feels empty, given the lack of action,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cNo one has held Israel accountable.\u201d\n\nIn their letter to Biden, the Palestinian clergymen reiterated their appeal: \u201cThis land has been crying for peace and justice for 75 years. It is time justice is served. It is time everybody can live with dignity in this land. The Palestinian and Israeli children deserve to live, hope and dream.\u201d\n\nWhen Isaac returns to Bethlehem at the end of the week for the start of the Advent season, he and his colleagues intend to set up a small Nativity scene with rocks and debris piled atop it. \u201cThis is what Christmas now means to us that we see Jesus being born among those who have lost everything, who are under the rubble,\u201d Isaac said.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/29/palestinian-christians-christmas-ceasefire-cancel/", "nearest_hist_news": [{"image_file_name": "127774181-phoenix-arizona-republic-Dec-25-1957-p-1.jpg", "headline": "Worries\nOf World\nMuted\n", "article": "A WORLD beset by cold\nwar tensions observed to-\nday its first Christmas at\nthe threshold of the fan-\ntastic age of space.\n\nThrough the heavens\nwhirled new Soviet stars.\nOn earth,\u2019 people of many.\nlands thought of missile\nwarfare triggered by toggle\nswitches and prayed that peace\nmight prevail.\n\nAn old world troubled by old\nstrife was about to set a nervous\nfoot into the newness of the be-\n\nyond with its own problems still\nunsolved,\n\nUndeclared wars were unresolv-\ned in Algeria and Ifni in North\nAfrica, There was civil strife in\nCuba and Cyprus.

Then he got lead poisoning.", "clean_text": "Listen 9 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save\n\nSarah and Ricky Callahan thought nothing of it when a doctor tested their son, Rudy, for lead at a checkup, a routine blood test for all young children in Maryland. But when his levels came back at nearly six times the minimum risk threshold for lead poisoning, they were worried. Surely, there had been a mistake. They had been so careful when it came to their only child, a redhead who loves to build things with blocks and help unload the dishwasher, pulling out all the utensils.\n\nSuddenly, their Maryland home felt like what Ricky Callahan described as a \u201cdeath trap.\u201d Was it the furniture? The carpet? Rudy\u2019s toys? Inspectors checked all of that and more \u2014 the water, the dishes, his crib \u2014 and found nothing suspect.\n\nMonths went by, and then a friend at Sarah Callahan\u2019s work in whom she had confided about her son\u2019s lead poisoning forwarded an article about a Food and Drug Administration recall of the same pureed fruit pouches Rudy had eaten for months. A lightbulb went on.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I read the FDA announcement I knew that was the source of my son\u2019s lead poisoning,\u201d Callahan said in a phone interview from the family\u2019s home in Calvert County, about an hour from Washington.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration announced last week that it had received 52 reports of children up to 4 years old potentially exposed to lead in contaminated apple cinnamon fruit puree pouches manufactured by a company in Ecuador and sold under WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks brands.\n\nWhile the FDA won\u2019t identify the affected children, the Callahans reported their concerns to the agency after matching a pouch left in their cupboard to the contaminated lot numbers published last month, according to a copy of their complaint.\n\nAfter months without answers, it all added up.\n\nRudy\u2019s lead levels had peaked in a second screening, then dropped as he switched to a whole-foods diet on the advice of experts helping the family work to eliminate potential culprits. A favorite dish is now spinach with cheese and garlic.\n\nThe FDA said it is still investigating how the pouches were contaminated, but its \u201cleading hypothesis\u201d is that cinnamon \u2014 added to the applesauce Rudy loved \u2014 is the likely source. Complaints of suspected exposures have been identified in 25 states, the agency has reported, including three cases in Maryland and one in Virginia.\n\nThe other Maryland cases are from the Eastern Shore and the Baltimore area, said Chase Cook, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of Health. He declined to comment on the specifics of any cases.\n\nAn analysis of multiple lots of WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree detected extremely high concentrations of lead, officials said. Although young children with lead poisoning often show no symptoms, experts say exposure over time can cause lasting neurodevelopmental disabilities.\n\nThe Callahans are suing WanaBana in state court in Florida alleging negligence and fraud, saying the company should have known that its products contained lead, according to a complaint filed Tuesday that seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. The company did not respond to requests for comment about the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason why in 2023 families are dealing with lead poisoning of their toddlers, of their children, because of a fruit puree that claims to be healthy and safe and free of preservatives,\u201d said Nikki Guntner, a Pensacola attorney whose firm, Aylstock, Witkin, Kreis & Overholtz, represents the Callahans and other parents whose children had elevated lead levels after ingesting contaminated apple puree.\n\nWanaBana did not respond to questions Monday but in a previous statement said it has initiated a voluntary recall of the affected batches and is working closely with the FDA to investigate the source of the contamination.\n\nIn a statement, the FDA said it is working with state, federal and international partners to investigate the source of the cinnamon and the point of contamination as well as whether additional products are potentially contaminated. The agency is screening incoming shipments of cinnamon from multiple countries for lead contamination and said it has not yet detected elevated lead in imported cinnamon.\n\n\u201cIn this instance, the FDA encourages manufacturers that import cinnamon and products that contain cinnamon to be extra vigilant to ensure their products do not contain elevated levels of lead,\u201d agency officials said.\n\nWhile FDA officials said contaminated pouches have been seen on shelves at Dollar Tree stores in multiple states, a Dollar Tree spokeswoman said stores have locked registers to prevent sales of the brand\u2019s pouches and instructed stores to remove the product from shelves.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the FDA\u2019s recent report and have worked with our store operations teams to ensure the recalled WanaBana Apple Cinnamon Fruit Puree pouches are no longer in our stores and destroyed according to FDA guidelines,\u201d the spokeswoman said in a statement.\n\nResearch shows exposure to even small amounts of heavy metals such as lead at an early age may increase the risk of several health problems, as well as prospective long-term cognitive consequences that may not show up for years.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nBarbara Moore, a pediatric nurse practitioner and director of the lead poisoning program at Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital in Baltimore, said a child can ingest or inhale lead particles. The material goes into the bloodstream and crosses the blood-brain barrier, which can affect brain development, leading to lower IQ, speech delays and fine motor delays, and can affect growth. Older children may experience attention-deficit disorder, impulsivity problems and learning problems, she said.\n\nThe longer lead is in the body, the more significant the risk, but early intervention can help a child reach their optimal development level, Moore said.\n\nA high percentage of environmental investigations show the source has been lead dust or lead paint, Moore said; however, she has noticed more public health alerts for contamination in imported spices.\n\nParents \u201cmay feel a twinge of guilt that they thought they were doing something healthy for their children, giving them a healthy pouch,\u201d she said.\n\nMost children have no clear immediate symptoms after a lead exposure, but experts recommend that parents concerned a child may be at risk ask their primary care provider or local health department for a blood test.\n\nMonica Mehta, Rudy\u2019s pediatrician, said she often hears pushback from parents reluctant to see their 1- or 2-year-olds stuck for a blood lead test, but that the Callahans\u2019 experience underscores the importance of routine screening.\n\nThe FDA has previously warned about high levels of heavy metals in baby and toddler foods. Heavy metals can leach into fruits and vegetables from soil or water contaminated by pesticides, fertilizers and other sources, or they can be introduced to foods as additives and mineral or vitamin mixes. The focus was prompted by a 2021 congressional report that found many of the products made by the country\u2019s largest commercial baby food manufacturers contain significant levels of lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury.\n\nAlthough the agency has set maximum allowable levels of metals such as lead in bottled water, it had not previously regulated levels of metals in baby and toddler foods, with the exception of arsenic in rice cereal \u2014 an effort that is now underway.\n\nThe plans are of little comfort to the Callahans, who began feeding Rudy, now 15 months, the pouches at about 9 months old as he transitioned from breast milk to solid food. They were a regular part of his diet from May through August, and he sometimes consumed as many as six a day, according to Sarah Callahan\u2019s complaint to the FDA.\n\n\u201cWe took a lot of precautions when picking out his food and \u2026 were giving him things which we thought were healthy,\u201d said Ricky Callahan, 36.\n\nAfter Rudy\u2019s first test on Aug. 22, the state lab detected blood lead levels of 19.8 micrograms per deciliter, his parents said. That\u2019s nearly six times the level at which the state identifies children at risk for lead poisoning, 3.5 micrograms per deciliter.\n\nThe result triggered the state to call the Callahans and made Rudy eligible for close monitoring. A second draw two weeks later on Sept. 1 showed an even higher level, 22.5 micrograms per deciliter, and a few days later they began the new whole-foods diet, the family said. He had his last pouch on Sept. 6.\n\nAnother two weeks passed, and his next test showed little change, 22.4 micrograms per deciliter. But by Sept. 26, his levels were down to 14.3 micrograms per deciliter, an encouraging sign that the source of the lead was declining.\n\nA full month passed before Sarah Callahan read about the applesauce recall on Oct. 30 and scoured their home for pouches, finding one. It matched the contaminated lot numbers reported by WanaBana and the FDA, and she reported the case to the FDA, which prompted the state to call the Callahans again.\n\nThrough a process of elimination, said Sarah Callahan, 39, officials she has spoken to believe the pouches are the most likely source after two home inspections, a water test, soil test and blood tests of the parents found nothing, and because the new diet helped and the puree batch numbers matched.\n\nEven with the probable source identified, the Callahans are on edge, waiting to see if Rudy hits milestones at the same pace as other children his age. The Callahans worked with Calvert County Public Schools on an early intervention plan for Rudy, who has speech delays, and a specialist comes to their home every two weeks to track his development.\n\n\u201cI am just concerned about his future,\u201d said Sarah Callahan. \u201cI want the best for my son.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated with additional comment.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/28/applesauce-recall-lead-poisoning-families/", "nearest_hist_news": [{"image_file_name": "251011435-centralia-evening-sentinel-Oct-17-1975-p-1.jpg", "headline": "FDA Issues\nLead Warning\nOn Babv Food\n", "article": "VV #RaFSSee Vie atid thf ih srt\nFood and Drug Administration\nsays potentially hazardous lev-\nels of lead are showing up in\ncanned baby food.\n\nLead poisoning can cause\nbrain damage and other prob-\nlems, particularly in children.\nLead in canned foods could\ncome from the solder or other\nmetal in the can.\n\nIn addition, the agency said it\nfound that \u2018\u2018lead levels in some\nadult canned foods are undesir-\nably high from a long-range\npublic health perspective.\u201d\u2019\n\nThe FDA said it will focus on\ngetting the levels of the\npoisonous metal in canned baby\nand infant food curbed and also\nwill seek reductions of lead\nlevels in adult foods frequently\neaten by children,\n\nThe agency announced the\nresults of a survey it made of\n2,900 samples of 41 different\nfoods produced during 1973.\n\n\u201cOf the (canned) baby foods,\norange juice had the highest\nmean lead level.

The fuel on this flight was made from waste fats and plant sugars and emits 70% less carbon than petroleum-based jet fuel, according to a press release. It landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nExperts say sustainable aviation fuels may one day play a big role in shrinking the aviation industry\u2019s carbon footprint \u2014 even though its production is minuscule today. SAF accounts for about 0.1% of airlines\u2019 current fuel consumption.\n\n\u201cSAF is a major aspect of the transition for aviation [to zero carbon emissions], and it\u2019s especially critical this decade,\u201d said Andrew Chen, principal for aviation decarbonization at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a clean-energy think tank. \u201cBut today, our big issue is we don\u2019t make enough SAF.\u201d\n\nVirgin Atlantic\u2019s 100% SAF flight is a one-time stunt, and the airline won\u2019t regularly offer all-SAF flights. Standard jet engines aren\u2019t designed to run on only sustainable fuel, and it is too expensive and rare for it to be practical for airlines to run all-SAF routes.\n\nStill, Chen says it\u2019s a milestone. \u201cIt\u2019s a really important flight to highlight the progress that\u2019s being made, the need for more SAF and the critical role they can play in decarbonizing aviation,\u201d he said.\n\nA bridge to zero-carbon flight\n\nSustainable aviation fuels are a broad category that includes biofuels made from raw materials such as corn, animal fat, algae, municipal trash and sewage. By definition, they must emit at least 50% less carbon than petroleum-based jet fuel, according to federal guidelines.\n\nBut all of these fuels still produce some emissions. SAF, on its own, will not get the airline industry to zero carbon emissions.\n\nTo do that, the industry will have to develop new technologies that will allow planes to run on electric batteries, liquid hydrogen or some other as-yet-unproven fuel source. But it will take years of research to fully develop these technologies, and decades more for airlines to fully replace their existing fleets with planes that can run on new fuels, according to Chen.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIn the meantime, existing planes will keep running on liquid fuel. \u201cThere\u2019s no getting around having to burn a fuel, so SAF is our way to displace fossil fuels\u201d and reduce planes\u2019 carbon emissions now, Chen said.\n\nAn immediate solution\n\nThe main advantage of SAF is that they are \u201cdrop-in\u201d fuels, meaning they can have an impact right away because they can be blended with standard jet fuel and poured into engines.\n\nBut there\u2019s a limit on how much sustainable fuel a standard jet engine can take, according to Chen. Petroleum-based jet fuel contains aromatic compounds that keep jet engines running properly. Many versions of SAF don\u2019t have these compounds.\n\nTo operate the flight powered only by SAF, Virgin Atlantic mixed a fat-based biofuel with a bit of plant-based \u201csynthetic aromatic kerosene,\u201d a form of sustainable aviation fuel made from plant sugars that has the aromatic compounds needed to keep a jet engine running smoothly.\n\nThe absence of aromatics is an obstacle for a 100% SAF flight, but Chen calls that a \u201cchampagne problem.\u201d First, he said, the industry has to figure out how to ramp up sustainable fuel production so that it makes up more than 0.1% of jet fuel.\n\n\u201cI would love it if we were talking about the fact that we\u2019re bumping up against blending limits,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not there yet. We still have a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nSAF supply and demand are limited\n\nThe SAF market is small and growing slowly. Chen says it suffers from a chicken-and-egg problem: Airlines don\u2019t want to buy SAF because it can be several times more expensive than standard aviation fuel. And fuel refiners don\u2019t want to invest in new manufacturing facilities \u2014 which could bring down the cost of sustainable fuels \u2014 because there isn\u2019t enough demand from airlines.\n\nGovernments and industry groups are trying to break that impasse and jump-start the growth of the SAF market.\n\nIn the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act offers tax credits to airlines that buy SAF, while the European Union has passed laws requiring airlines to use them. In Europe, airlines must use 70% SAF by 2050.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Economic Forum has led an industry push to create carbon credits based on SAF sales. Through an elaborate accounting framework, airlines can calculate how many carbon emissions they\u2019re avoiding through their use of sustainable fuels and sell those credits to companies or passengers who want to offset the emissions they generate by flying.\n\n\u201cWe see a lot more attention, a lot more activity and investment and announcements around SAF partnerships, joint ventures and long-term off-take agreements,\u201d Chen said. \u201cSo all these things are good signs, but we\u2019re still in the early portion of growing this market to what it needs to be.\u201d", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/11/28/virgin-atlantic-sustainable-flight-lands-saf/", "nearest_hist_news": [{"image_file_name": "130714824-ludington-daily-news-Jan-19-1976-p-1.jpg", "headline": "The Plane\n", "article": "WASHINGTON (UPI) \u2014 The age of passenger air travel at twice\nthe speed of sound \u2014 faster than a rifle bullet \u2014 dawns this week\nwith the first commercial flights of the needle-nose Concorde\nsupersonic transport.\n\nIts future is ominously clouded.\n\nEnvironmentalists who helped kill an American SST project five\nyears ago are waging a bitter fight to ban the Anglo-French Con-\ncorde from the United States.

Starting Thursday, United will become the latest airline to offer grab-and-go stations for economy fliers. The service will begin with select routes from Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport as part of the rollout of United\u2019s new Airbus A321neo plane.\n\nAccording to United, these kiosks will include a \u201climited supply of water and the snacks offered during the complimentary service,\u201d with items like fruit bars from That\u2019s It, Undercover chocolate quinoa crisps and Savory snack mix. Those items will become available only after flight attendants have made their first pass, United said.\n\nThese self-serve stations are just the most recent iteration from a major U.S. airline on long- and medium-haul domestic flights. The JetBlue Pantry has been available since 2014, when it was called \u201cThe Marketplace.\u201d It was rebranded in 2019, when JetBlue introduced the Airbus A321neo. Self-serve snacks are now offered on some of the \u201caircraft that fly JetBlue\u2019s longest flight routes,\u201d including an A321ceo, according to an airline representative.\n\n\u201cPassengers really like this. And when passengers are happy, the crew is happy, and when the crew is happy, passengers are happier,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and president of the research and advisory firm Atmosphere Research Group. The do-it-yourself snack stations, he added, \u201cmake it easier for passengers to have more enjoyable flights, and to reduce the burden on the cabin crew having to run back and forth to serve individual passengers.\u201d\n\nNot all experts agree, however, that self-service snacks have the customer\u2019s best interest in mind.\n\nRobert W. Mann, an airline industry analyst and consultant, called the new feature as just \u201cthe latest airline manifestation\u201d of self-service options.\n\nMann gave the example of Delta and American Airlines, who, in the late \u201990s and early 2000s, provided grab-and-go meal bags at the gate before boarding. \u201cThese days, those amenities seem generous, though at the time they replaced hot entrees served in the cabin,\u201d Mann said. He added that both the American \u201cBistro Bag\u201d and Delta \u201cSky Deli\u201d options were \u201cpretty much panned if not reviled by passengers.\u201d\n\nUnited and JetBlue\u2019s all-plane snack stations can be read as part of a longer trend toward airline optimization (and consequent cost-cutting). \u201cThe self-service is part of a broader trend just in customer service overall. And you see it across other parts of the airline as well,\u201d said Clark Johns, an airline expert and consultant at Alton Aviation Consultancy. It\u2019s evident from airline investment in self-service mobile apps for check-in and flight management, as well as the spread of self-bag-check kiosks, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a good utilization, as well, of the cabin crew\u2019s time to give more touchpoints and time to those customers that need it,\u201d Johns added.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nHarteveldt agreed. \u201cWhat these self-service pantries do is help the airlines do a better job of pleasing customers,\u201d he said, calling it \u201cempowerment to the passenger.\u201d\n\nExperts agreed more traditional refreshment service won\u2019t likely change in the near future. Flight attendants still need to serve alcohol and hot meals, after all. But a more widespread adoption of snack bars could reduce strain on the flight crew in the long term.\n\n\u201cIt likely depends on costs, customer acceptance, comments and flight attendant post-flight write-ups,\u201d Mann said. He cautioned, though, that such a change could be \u201can inconvenience [or] annoyance to customers, especially aisle seat customers, sitting close to galleys where other passengers queue up in the aisles to \u2018grab and go\u2019 back to their own seats.\u201d\n\nU.S. airlines are generally already working with the minimum number of flight attendants per trip, Harteveldt said. For safety reasons, the Federal Aviation Administration requires one flight attendant for every 50 passengers. That means there\u2019s not as much room to cut staff as there would be with the installation of self-service check-in and bag-tagging machines at the airport, for example.\n\nWhether more airlines take the leap to add self-service snack bars on their domestic flights is still up in the air. Having such a service takes up precious real estate on planes; some of American Airlines\u2019 A321neos for example, use spare mid-cabin space for an extra bathroom instead.\n\nOn newer aircraft like the A321neo or the Bombardier CRJ-550, a 50-person plane that United uses for its most premium routes, a trend toward more flexible configurations makes these types of self-services possible, potentially opening the door for more airlines to join the trend as they add new planes.\n\nIn the meantime, having these self-service stations on select airlines could help separate them from competitors. According to Harteveldt, it is a \u201csmall but meaningful point of differentiation in an industry that long ago became a homogenous blob of sameness.\u201d\n\nResearch has shown that even the most loyal fliers are often picking the airline they\u2019ll fly on \u201ctrip to trip,\u201d Harteveldt said. Features such as free WiFi, better in-flight entertainment or on-demand snack options, though they seem small, can add up from a customer\u2019s point of view.\n\n\u201cWhere 80 to 90 percent of what an airline does is the same between airlines \u2014 especially ones like JetBlue and United \u2014 that puts an awful lot of importance on remaining 10 or 20 percent to help stand out from key competitors,\u201d he said. \u201cIf part of that differentiation is a self-service pantry, then so be it.\u201d", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/11/28/united-flights-snack-bar/", "nearest_hist_news": [{"image_file_name": "303938595-ironwood-daily-globe-Jun-22-1978-p-1.jpg", "headline": "Streaker Surprises Airplane Passengers\n", "article": "MIAMI (AP) \u2014 National Airlines Flight 51 was high above\nthe plains of Texas when a vision, of sorts, appeared in the\naisle, Passengers gasped.

People were commenting on the page \u201cCentral MN Moose on the Loose\u201d and posting photos of their sightings of a young bull moose one resident had named Rutt. They said they\u2019d seen the massive creature slowly walking alone across south-central Minnesota farmland, to their great surprise. This was hundreds of miles outside of a natural moose habitat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like seeing polar bears in Texas,\u201d one excited resident wrote.\n\nThe moose that prompted the initial Facebook page in 2018 was hit by a truck and killed while crossing a highway, said Johnson, 56, who lives in Dassel, Minn.\n\n\u201cEveryone was really sad to lose him,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nSo when another moose was spotted roaming through the fields, he became a bit of a sensation.\n\nJohnson quickly renamed her group page for Rutt, and people tracked the antlered animal starting about 500 miles from the northeastern Minnesota and Canadian border known for being a moose habitat.\n\nHe was slowly making his way back north.\n\n\u201cEveryone was excited to see him \u2014 we\u2019ve all been cheering him on as he heads north,\u201d Johnson said, explaining that moose are typically found in the northeastern part of the state near the Canadian border, about 275 miles from where she lives. \u201cSome of them said he\u2019d been spotted even earlier in South Dakota and Iowa, hundreds of miles from where a moose should be.\u201d\n\nWithin weeks, her group page went from about 1,000 followers to more than 36,000.\n\nPeople are breathlessly posting about the enormous mammal, making crafts and coloring pages of him. Someone painted a rock in his likeness, and other people have created Rutt Christmas ornaments. Newspapers, including the West Central Tribune, have featured him.\n\n\u201cThis should be our new Minnesota flag!\u201d someone commented about the painted rock.\n\nBernie Stang said she spotted the moose and photographed him in late October, believing he was lost and steadfastly making his way to his moose family.\n\n\u201cThis moose has no clue how much joy and happiness he has brought to so many,\u201d Stang said. \u201cI think the world was hungry for a happy story.\u201d\n\nThe moose is estimated to be about a year and a half old, Johnson said, and he was named by Stang\u2019s daughter, Holly Stang, after a moose in the 2003 animated movie \u201cBrother Bear.\u201d Holly Stang is one of the people who had taken videos of the moose when he was spotted near Grove City, Minn.\n\nNobody is sure how Rutt ended up hanging out in harvested cornfields, but it\u2019s rare to see a moose in a prairie environment, said Todd Froberg, the coordinator of the big-game program at the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\n\nMoose are generally solitary animals that like cold climates and gravitate to dense forests near water in the winter. They grow to about six feet tall, and their height makes it difficult for them to bend down to eat grasses, so they generally survive on twigs, tree bark and pine cones on which they forage above ground level. Their typical life span in the wild is 10 to 12 years.\n\n\u201cA majority of Minnesotans have not seen a moose in the wild,\u201d Froberg said, adding that moose mostly live in isolated areas of the north. \u201cThey\u2019re huge animals, so [Rutt] would definitely stand out in the farmland region.\u201d\n\nFroberg said Minnesota has about 3,600 moose, down from a 2005 population of more than 8,000 because of climate change, changes in forestry composition and diseases including brain worm. Nationally, a total of about 300,000 moose live in 19 states, according to Wildlife Informer.\n\n\u201cThe population decline isn\u2019t just because of one thing \u2014 it\u2019s an accumulation of many things,\u201d Froberg said.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nRutt appears to be healthy, so wildlife officers do not plan to intervene and relocate him, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll let it be a moose and go back to wherever he\u2019s going,\u201d he said. \u201cMoose are nothing to mess around with, so for the welfare of the public and the animal, I wouldn\u2019t get too close.\u201d\n\nThe tall herbivores weigh up to 1,600 pounds and can be dangerous: In September, a moose was spooked by a woman walking her dog in Colorado, and the startled animal head-butted her and stomped on her.\n\nFollowers of Johnson\u2019s group Facebook page were worried when Rutt wasn\u2019t seen for about a week in mid-November. They thought he might have suffered a similar fate to the first moose featured on the \u201cMoose on the Loose\u201d page, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cWe all took a deep breath on November 19th when Rutt was spotted again and we realized he had safely made it across the interstate and was still heading north,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cPretty soon, he\u2019ll be in the forest, closer to moose territory, and we won\u2019t see him as much.\u201d\n\nRutt\u2019s Facebook followers say they are thankful they\u2019ve had the opportunity to watch him virtually on his journey north.\n\n\u201cThis has been so neat to watch him as he made his journey home,\u201d one woman wrote on Johnson\u2019s Facebook group page. \u201cFeel almost emotional that we will eventually lose track of him, but glad he is getting to where he wanted to be. Live long and happy Rutt!\u201d\n\nJohnson has put together a list of everywhere the moose has been seen, from Flandreau, S.D., to Sebeka, Minn. If anyone sends new photos, she\u2019ll wait for several hours to post them to discourage people from showing up at the spot where Rutt was spotted and possibly bothering him, she said.\n\n\u201cMy favorite part of this is how everyone has come together to root Rutt on,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him personally, but I\u2019ve received so many messages about the joy he\u2019s brought to people\u2019s lives.\u201d", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/11/28/moose-loose-minnesota-rutt-facebook/", "nearest_hist_news": [{"image_file_name": "304729377-ottumwa-courier-Jan-10-1987-p-1.jpg", "headline": "Lovesick moose heads\nfor greener pastures\n", "article": "MONTPELIER, Vt.

They said Israel is willing to keep extending the pause as long as those women continue to be released, 10 at a time. If those releases are honored, the official said, they are willing to consider Hamas proposals to expand the exchanges to include men and Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe official added that the continued releases will in no way \u201clead to a permanent cease-fire.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to stave off a resumption of hostilities, CIA Director William J. Burns went to Qatar on Tuesday to meet with his Israeli counterpart in hopes of brokering a deal that would include several more days of quiet and the release of not just women and children held hostage but also men and military personnel.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken, meanwhile, will again visit the region, where he is expected to push to maintain the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, secure the release of more hostages and emphasize the need for the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nQatar \u2014 the key mediator in the Israel-Hamas negotiations to date \u2014 also said it hopes that the humanitarian pause will be further extended and that the hostage releases would go beyond women and children.\n\n\u201cThe priority at this moment is civilian women and children,\u201d said Al Ansari, a spokesman for the Qatari Foreign Ministry. \u201cMilitary men will come into discussion\u201d after that, he said.\n\nThe United Nations, which has repeatedly expressed concern over the weeks of bombing and then ground combat in the densely populated Gaza Strip, also called for a full humanitarian cease-fire rather than a pause.\n\n\u201cThe humanitarian situation in Gaza remains catastrophic and requires the urgent entry of additional aid and supplies in a smooth, predictable, and continuous manner to alleviate the unbearable suffering of Palestinians in Gaza,\u201d Tor Wennesland, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have accused each other of violating the pause amid small skirmishes in northern Gaza, but so far, the allegations do not appear to have threatened the agreement.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said that three explosive devices were detonated in the northern Gaza Strip near IDF forces and that shots were fired. A spokesman for Hamas\u2019s military wing who uses the name Abu Obaida said that \u201cas a result of a clear violation by the enemy of the truce agreement in northern Gaza today, there was field friction and our fighters dealt with this violation.\u201d\n\nThe combat pause has provided some respite from the relentless bombardment of Gaza, as well as relief for Israeli and Palestinian families whose loved ones either have been held hostage in Gaza or are imprisoned in Israel. But on the ground in Gaza, the pause has been overshadowed by the apparently inevitable return to war.\n\nMore than 13,300 Palestinians have been killed since Israel declared war on Hamas after Palestinian militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel on Oct. 7. Gaza residents have used the pause to try to scramble for warm clothes and supplies, visit devastated homes and recover bodies from the rubble-strewn streets.\n\nHanaa Moeen, a 38-year-old mother of three from Gaza City who was sheltering in an apartment with six other families in the southern city of Rafah, said the only change during the pause was that she has been able to venture outside.\n\n\u201cExtending the cessation of war for two days is both good and painful, because we know that the war will return, and nothing has changed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are now in the winter season, facing difficulty in acquiring winter clothes and the need for heating.\u201d\n\nThe pause has given her and her family time to ponder what comes next if they can survive the war, she said. \u201cWe do not know if we have a house to return to in Gaza City.\u201d\n\nIn the north, Nahed Afif, 55, who was sheltering at a U.N.-run school in Gaza City, said that although some aid has reached the area during the pause, supplies still fall short of the \u201cnecessities of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur desire is not just to extend the truce but to bring an end to the war entirely. I long to sleep in my bed in my house,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s destroyed, I\u2019d be content to sleep in a tent next to it,\u201d he said, adding that Israeli tanks were blocking his way home.\n\nWatching the waves roll in from the Mediterranean, Kefah Abu Safiyya said she came with her family to the beach for some peace and quiet and \u201cto catch our breath, even if only for a little while.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis very short truce provides a brief respite, but what will happen afterward is uncertain. We seek a change of atmosphere, even if it lasts only for a few seconds,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if we will live or become part of those being killed.\u201d\n\nReleased hostages have described deteriorating conditions during their weeks of captivity, with thinning food rations and heavy bombing. Ronit Lubetzky, director of the Ichilov Hospital children\u2019s department, said in a news briefing Tuesday that the nine children the hospital had received had to undergo \u201ccomplex\u201d medical assessments and had suffered from poor nutrition during their captivity.\n\nMost Palestinians released or slated for release have not been convicted of any crime and were awaiting trial, according to Jessica Montell, the executive director of the Israeli human rights organization HaMoked, although she added that Hamas should have released hostages \u201cunconditionally.\u201d", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/28/israel-gaza-hostages-negotiations-pause-truce/", "nearest_hist_news": [{"image_file_name": "239524651-olathe-daily-news-Oct-11-1972-p-1.jpg", "headline": "Kissinger still in Paris\n\nPeace talks continued\n", "article": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Presidential adviser\nHenry Kissinger and North Vietnamese negotiators\ncompleted a third day of private talks in Paris\nTuesday and agreed to extend their sessions into a\nfourth day the White House announced.\n\nWhite House press secretary Ronald L.

In its journey from urban planning circles to the public arena, some have falsely claimed it will imprison people within a 15-minute radius of their homes (it\u2019s about convenience and freedom, advocates argue, not isolation). Some urban planners object to the idea. They say that not everyone\u2019s workplace can be within a 15 minute walk, shrinking a metropolitan area\u2019s job market.\n\nBut amid smoldering housing and climate crises, the 15-minute-city concept offers a way out of both, reducing our dependence on cars to go about our daily lives and freeing us to spend our time as we choose. To realize this, we need to look to an unlikely place: the first suburbs.\n\nMetro sapiens\n\nThroughout recorded human history, less than 5 percent of people lived in cities. But in the relative blink of an eye, this situation reversed. People began leaving the countryside in droves during the Industrial Revolution. By 2008, the urban population had eclipsed the rural one. The gap continues to widen. Seventy percent of the world\u2019s population is expected to live in cities by 2050.\n\nUrban migration has supercharged human prosperity: An estimated 80 percent of the world\u2019s economic activity now occurs in cities. This has reduced per capita environmental impact in some high-income nations. City dwellers emit as much as 20 percent less compared to their rural counterparts, largely thanks to more efficient transport, heating and cooking, according to studies in the United Kingdom, Finland, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nBut cities are staggering under their success.\n\nCongestion and unaffordability are pushing people from many cities into expensive housing in far suburbs or exurbs. Vehicles have been the leading source of greenhouse gases in the United States since 2017.\n\nFew things exemplify this trajectory better than commuting in the United States.\n\nThe response has been the 15-minute city.\n\nThe rise of the 15-minute city\n\nConceived in 2016 by Carlos Moreno, the 15-minute city imagines putting \u201chumans and their well-being as the main purpose of urban organization,\u201d Moreno, an urbanist and professor at the Sorbonne University in Paris, told The Washington Post in March. The idea is \u201cto promote sustainability and health by reducing car dependency and increasing physical activity,\u201d primarily through walking, biking and mass transit.\n\nThis decentralized urban planning model has become a rallying cry for politicians and urban activists around the world fed up with exclusive single-use zoning, car-centric development and homes segregated from work, retail shopping and other amenities.\n\nYet the discussion about 15-minute cities obscures a central tension at the heart of the idea: How can all of us live within 15 minutes of all amenities and jobs in cities housing millions of people?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a very controversial idea in urban planning that it\u2019s better when you can reach things close by in a city,\u201d says David Zipper, a visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School studying transportation policy. \u201cBut you can take it too far. \u2026 Everyone can live and work within 15 minutes of where they want to go? That\u2019s just not how things work.\u201d\n\nThis tension has shaped cities for millennia. Known as Marchetti\u2019s constant, after Cesare Marchetti, the Italian physicist who identified it in 1994, it describes a nearly universal rule of human behavior: People tend to travel no more than one hour per day. This constant has defined the dimensions of cities since they arose about 10,000 years ago.\n\nAncient villages tended to grow no bigger than about five kilometers, a radius walkable in half an hour, reports Quartz. Today, the average one-way commute in the age of automobiles remains remarkably consistent in the United States (27.6 minutes), Canada (26.2) and the U.K. (29.5). No matter the speed or form of transportation, humans will travel 30 minutes for daily trips.\n\nFor cities, this number is critical because it defines how big their job markets can get.\n\n\u201cThe welfare of cities is dependent on their labor markets,\u201d Alain Bertaud, an urban planner at New York University\u2019s Marron Institute, wrote in an influential 2014 essay. \u201cThe larger the market, the more innovative and productive the city.\u201d By putting as many people as possible near desirable jobs, those who live in low-income communities can reach additional employment opportunities, research has shown.\n\nWithout this dynamic, as a tour of America\u2019s Rust Belt reveals, you get decay. \u201cWithout a functioning labor market there is no city,\u201d Bertaud writes. The main objective of urban planning should be mobility, he argues, preventing commuting time from rising as the size of the labor market increases, and freeing people to spend their time elsewhere.\n\nA tale of two kinds of trips\n\nDoes this doom the 15-minute city? Not necessarily, says Adie Tomer, an urban economics and infrastructure policy expert at Brookings Metro.\n\nBut we need to make a key distinction. \u201cThere are really two kinds of trips: the commute and everything else,\u201d says Tomer. \u201cThere might be one perfect job for you in that [city\u2019s] labor market. But that\u2019s at a completely different proximity than you need for your bakery, grocery store or daily activities.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAmenities are relatively interchangeable. Almost any pharmacy or pizza place will do. But only a few companies may want to hire you in a city.\n\nFrom an urban economist\u2019s perspective, the perfect 15-minute city fosters local businesses and amenities 15 minutes (or less) to optimize free time and quality of life. It maximizes economic opportunity, ideally by many modes of transportation, within a 30-minute radius of people\u2019s homes. \u201cThe 15-minute city vision is really one of consumption,\u201d Zipper says.\n\nIn the United States, the challenge is that communities have been built around the personal vehicle. Whereas life once revolved around being relatively close to things, virtually everything now involves getting behind the wheel. The average American traveled 40 miles per day in 2017, up from 19.5 miles in 1969, according to Tomer\u2019s research.\n\n\u201cWe are so deep in the suburbanization mode that the majority of trips in the U.S. are already under two miles, but we use our vehicles for them at disproportionate rates compared to almost any other country,\u201d Tomer says. \u201cAmericans have been hiding both the social and household costs of this model we\u2019ve built.\u201d The United States now ranks highest among its peers for roadway deaths, per capita greenhouse gas emissions, miles traveled and infrastructure costs.\n\nLuckily, the United States has already built 15-minute cities across the country: the first suburbs.\n\nWhy you might already be living in a 15-minute city\n\nIn the 1890s, the first streetcar suburbs emerged: Cleveland\u2019s Shaker Heights, Atlanta\u2019s Inman Park, Somerville, Mass., outside Boston and Philadelphia\u2019s Main Line are among the most famous, with electric streetcars ferrying workers to and from urban jobs. It was the dominant way American cities grew until the 1930s.\n\nWhat helped these older, inner-ring communities thrive was a core of mixed-use development \u2014 high and low-density housing alongside shops and other services \u2014 next to fast, affordable transportation. The dominance of the automobile, and the 1926 Supreme Court approval of more sweeping zoning ordinances created the distant suburbs we know today.\n\nBut Tomer thinks the first suburbs are these 15-minute cities in waiting.\n\nIn his study Building for Proximity, Tomer and his colleague Caroline George studied Americans\u2019 daily trips in the 110 largest U.S. metro areas using a mix of information, including cellphone geolocation data and credit card transactions.\n\nPeople living within three miles of what he calls \u201cactivity centers\u201d (commercial strips, but also malls, museums, libraries, shops, schools and restaurants), exhibited radically reduced daily travel.\n\nThose living near at least five activity centers were estimated to travel 14,500 fewer annual miles, emit one-third less carbon and save more than $1,000 in transportation expenses each year compared to those living seven miles away, the distance a typical American must travel for shopping and recreational activities.\n\nAmerica\u2019s first suburbs already enjoy multifamily residential developments, neighborhood stores, shops and cultural institutions and efficient access to downtown jobs by car, public transit and biking or walking.\n\n\u201cThese often are not 15-minute neighborhoods yet, but they have the bones for it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just have to do a little work.\u201d\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nMany of the changes needed are in the hands of local communities.\n\nTake parking. Eliminating parking requirements has removed the need for sprawling, underutilized parking lots for businesses, apartments and multifamily housing, a crucial step to realizing the 15-minute ideal. Since 2017, at least 35 cities or towns in North America have eliminated citywide parking mandates, more than one-third of them in the past year or so.\n\nHere\u2019s how 15-minute cities could rise near you, if you have the ear, and the votes, of your city council.\n\nBuild more housing, especially along busy corridors: First suburbs perfected this 100 years ago \u2014 and could do so again. By creating more places to live immediately next to hubs of commercial buildings, retail, food, market districts and, ideally, mass transit, both people and businesses benefit from the reduced time needed to get around. One of the best ways to do this is to let people build and live where they would like.\n\nAnd that would require \u2026\n\nLoosening up zoning laws: Many Parisians already live in a 15-minute city (or a five-minute one) despite prescriptive zoning. Paris\u2019s 40 square miles are served by an estimated 1,180 bakeries and 516 butcher shops, according to one government survey.\n\n\u201cThe abundance and variety of bakeries are not due to meticulous municipal planning but to market mechanisms,\u201d writes NYU\u2019s Bertaud. \u201cIf Parisians were to prefer herring to croissants for breakfast in the future, the market would adjust, and herring merchants will gradually replace the bakeries without any \u2018redesign\u2019 of Paris.\u201d\n\nYet in the United States, strict zoning laws have become de rigueur almost everywhere. With fewer rules on density and commercial uses near homes, many of us could already live in neighborhoods more like Paris and reach amenities by taking a short stroll. An analysis of New York neighborhoods found places with more permissive commercial zoning in 1961 enjoy more local trips today. The dominance of single-family zoning, even next to transit hubs, means fewer people have the choice to live near cities and amenities.\n\nProtect all forms of transportation: We design cities to quickly and efficiently move cars, not necessarily people.

Work was rough. Her car had broken down. And when she finally arrived home, Laithland discovered that the chicken she planned to cook for dinner had spoiled after sitting out all day. In the midst of it all, her then-6-year-old-daughter said or did something that sent Laithland\u2019s vocal reaction into the higher decibels. To this day, Laithland can\u2019t remember what made her so upset, but her child\u2019s response was one she\u2019ll never forget.\n\n\u201cI just lost it,\u201d said Laithland, a mother of two from Norman, Okla. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that my child was making herself small and pulling herself away from me. She was biting her lip so she wouldn\u2019t cry \u2014 she was handling my big feelings better than I was, and I\u2019m the adult. That was the point when I said \u2018This isn\u2019t working.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven the most gentle, positive or responsive of parents aren\u2019t immune to yelling at their children, especially when confronted with less-than-agreeable behavior or a failure to follow directions. But as Laithland experienced, yelling can often make parents and children feel worse, leading parents to search for more effective communication methods that still deliver the desired result.\n\nWhen parents recognize that yelling is often a response to something deeper than the child\u2019s behavior, it can help them modify their reactions, especially in times of stress, said Lisa Weed Phifer, a trauma-informed social emotional learning specialist in Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia. She\u2019s also co-author of \u201cParenting Toolbox: 125 Activities Therapists Use to Reduce Meltdowns, Increase Positive Behaviors & Manage Emotions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to figure out what\u2019s driving that yelling,\u201d Weed Phifer said. \u201cIs it some kind of communication issue between yourself and your child? Is it work stress coming out at home as yelling? We yell as our emotional response to stress. Thinking about what it is in your environment or in your life that\u2019s creating that stress can help you get a better grasp on it.\u201d\n\nUnderstand the science of a scream\n\nNumerous researchers have examined the reasons that animals, including humans, emit higher-pitched sounds we\u2019d characterize as screaming or yelling in response to certain stimuli.\n\nA study from a group of New York University neuroscientists said screams have a distinct \u201cacoustic signature\u201d that stimulates the amygdala, the area of the brain that reacts to fear. While normal speech rates fall between 4-5 Hertz (Hz), the units of frequency that measure sound, speech that exhibits what they defined as \u201croughness\u201d registers anywhere from 30-150 Hz. As researchers played samples of sounds from various sources, from normal speech to instruments, alarms and screams, the alarms and recorded screams registered higher in roughness.\n\nThe team then monitored subjects\u2019 brain activity as they heard each sound, finding greater responses in the amygdala when the screams and alarms were played. From an evolutionary perspective it makes sense \u2014 the unique acoustic signature of a scream could alert others to imminent danger or threats.\n\nAnother study, from researchers at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, had similar findings, with participants reacting more quickly to voices perceived as threatening or aggressive.\n\nMom or Dad yelling at a child to take out the trash is far removed from a legitimate concern about the child\u2019s safety if they run into the street or touch a hot stove, but the brain response is potentially the same. And the long-term effects of yelling can be harmful, with studies indicating children subject to regular harsh verbal discipline were at higher risk of depression and behavioral problems.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve asked a child to pick something up multiple times, and now your voice is louder that final time, that doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to a better outcome,\u201d Weed Phifer said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re in that emotional and stressed state, we\u2019re not really able to go through the problem-solving process of \u2018Is this really going to get the reaction that I want?\u2019\u201d\n\nLearn what to do instead\n\nIn addition to addressing their own state of mind, parents should give clear and direct messages to their children to minimize the perceived need to yell, said Jazmine McCoy, a clinical psychologist and mother of two in Sacramento.\n\n\u201cInstead of asking, \u2018Why don\u2019t you go take the trash out?\u2019 set a very clear time limit or expectation that you need them to take the trash out before they go play,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cI always recommend that parents get intentional about the instruction that they have, stop what they\u2019re doing and make sure their child isn\u2019t distracted. Make eye contact and get down on their level \u2014 especially for the little ones \u2014 and then give a clear instruction. That sets everybody up for success.\u201d\n\nIn other words, your kids might not be deliberately ignoring you \u2014 maybe they\u2019re hyper-focused on their toys, games, television or homework.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nMcCoy, who offers a free virtual workshop on yelling, suggests that parents figure out their own personal triggers \u2014 whether they\u2019re messy rooms, tantrums, picky eating or just refusing to listen \u2014 and not take a child\u2019s words or behavior in those areas so personally.\n\n\u201cSometimes we feel yelling is the only thing that works because it gets our child\u2019s attention,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cAlthough yelling might work in the short term, it could have the longer-term ramification of eroding the parent-child relationship, trust and rapport.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an outcome that Christi Rammel, a Centerville, Ohio, mother, wanted to avoid. Like many older millennial and Generation X parents, she grew up with spankings and yelling as a household norm, and initially wasn\u2019t against either when she had her own children.\n\nLike Laithland, a particularly bad day at work changed everything. Sleep-deprived and frustrated, Rammel remembers coming home and yelling at her young daughter for something that pushed her buttons. \u201cWhen I saw her cowering in the corner, I asked myself \u2018What kind of parent does this?\u2019\u201d Rammel said. \u201cI decided I didn\u2019t want to be that parent.\u201d\n\nRammel also realized how difficult it was to hear the stories from young abuse survivors she encountered as a nurse at a children\u2019s hospital and she began making connections to her own children\u2019s responses to yelling. Now a mother of four in a blended family, Rammel said she aims to make her home an emotionally safe place for her children to express their feelings and make mistakes.\n\n\u201cDo I still get frustrated? Yes,\u201d Rammel said. \u201cBut I find we all respond better when I calmly talk to them. Kids are going to have bad days just like adults. I remind myself daily that they\u2019re human and they\u2019re still learning.\u201d\n\nUnpack your past\n\n\u201cIf you feel yourself about to yell, take a deep breath and say \u2018Okay, maybe they\u2019re busy, let me go upstairs and see what\u2019s up,\u2019\u201d said Yolanda Williams, a Sherwood, Ark., mother of one. \u201cIf you\u2019re calling your kid\u2019s name and they\u2019re not answering, go and connect with them. Maybe put your hand on their shoulder or make sure that they can actually see your face. Change the way you communicate.\u201d\n\nWilliams also grew up in a home where her parents yelled often, and she expected to parent the same way until she became pregnant at 36 and began researching brain development and parenting styles.\n\nThe idea of gentle parenting or positive parenting resonated with Williams, but she felt that cultural, socioeconomic and environmental issues were often missing from the conversation. She understands the deeper reasons that many Black parents might spank or yell, and as a positive discipline coach, she works to address those factors to help parents explore a different approach.\n\n\u201cWe had to do things that were harmful to our children to keep them alive back in the day, but we\u2019re no longer where we were back in the 1800s,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to unpack when it comes to why we do things, but we have to do that work to treat our children with respect and see them as humans.\u201d\n\nStress can also be much deeper than a tough day at work, Williams said. Yelling at a child for eating too much food or wasting food, for example, could be a reaction to the sudden stress of having to figure out how to afford the family\u2019s next meal. Williams said helping the parent with resources to obtain more food could help reduce that stress and generate a calmer response to their child\u2019s action.\n\nLaithland also channeled her desire to yell less often into researching and joining gentle parenting groups on social media in the early 2010s. She and her husband, Jackson, now run Momma Cusses, a platform about their ongoing journey with responsive parenting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a perfect parent and there\u2019s no such thing as a parenting expert,\u201d Laithland said. \u201cYou\u2019re the best expert on your specific kids. While there are times I\u2019m convinced that my children\u2019s ability to listen and react is tied to how much demon I can summon with my vocal cords, I\u2019m no longer making myself bigger, in size or in volume, to intimidate them into the behavior that I expect from them.\u201d\n\nShannon Shelton Miller is a writer based in Dayton, Ohio.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/parenting/2023/11/28/parents-stop-yelling-advice/", "nearest_hist_news": [{"image_file_name": "241114154-logan-daily-news-Dec-18-1958-p-1.jpg", "headline": "It's OK, Dad, To Frustrate Children\n", "article": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cFor\npete's sake, clear out and let me\nshave!\u201d\n\nThat, sothe say, is bad.
