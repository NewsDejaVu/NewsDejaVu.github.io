| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resignation of the University of Pennsylvania’s president following her testimony over how to handle calls for the genocide of Jews has highlighted the tightrope school leaders are walking as students protest the war in Gaza — and fueled instant debate over how far colleges can go to restrict speech.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liz Magill’s departure, announced Saturday, divided politicians, academics and the nation, with some hailing it as a needed corrective to curb hateful rhetoric on college campuses. Republican lawmakers, who have argued in recent years that America’s most prestigious schools are also its most out-of-touch, were especially eager to paint universities as hotbeds of angry leftist rhetoric where liberal ideologies are tolerated, while conservative viewpoints are shut down.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democrats and Jewish groups celebrated the exit, too, which came after Magill refused to say, during testimony before Congress last week, that calling for the genocide of the Jews violated her school’s code of conduct.  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/12/10/antisemitism-college-presidents-penn-harvard-mit/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/12/10/antisemitism-college-presidents-penn-harvard-mit/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) — Dr. Clark Kerr implied Wed- nesday that his sudden resignation as president of the Univer- sity of California was triggered by a campus demonstration advocating obscene language as a basic freedom.   Kerr, 53, president of the nine-campus university system.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Martin Meyerson, 42, chan- cellor of the Berkeley campus, an- nounced their resignations late Tuesday effective March 25-26 when the university regents next meet. They made no explanations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Berkeley campus has been embroiled since last September in disorders and sit-in demonstrations by a student minority organized as the Free Speech Movement. The aim was primarily political, involv- ing the right to speak and collect funds on the campus for various causes such as the civil rights movement.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, seven persons, five of them students, were arrested for seemingly unrelated demonstra- tions on behalf of obscenity. They ‘shouted an obscene four-letter word into microphones and displayed it on signs, ©<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kerr and Meyerson an- nounced their resignations there was speculation that the univer- sity’s Board of Regents — already exasperated by the political Free Speech Movement — had pressured Kerr to order immediate expulsion of the students in the obscenity af- fair.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some quarters reported that Kerr had referred it to the faculty com- mittee set up to handle the politi- cal issue, and that the committee declined to act because it was not a political matter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerr issued a statement Wednes- day which lent strong support to these reports without actually con- firming them. ~~<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His statement said: “We are cur- rently faced with a new confronta- tion at Berkeley, potentially filled with great passion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Offenders must be disciplined, but due process must have its due place, and faculty committees should not seek to avoid their re- sponsibility for assisting in dis- cipline because of minor questions of internal jurisdiction and doubt about the ultimate state of the civil law.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerr went on to say, “I have joined in a dramatic step, which is not my inclination. I have done so to try to stop, to the extent I ‘can be helpful, the continuing and destructive degradation of freedom ‘into license and avoid a new con- frontation at Berkeley which could only damage the campus even more.”  |
