Military offi- cials say 15 Arabs have been killed. Palestinian reports put the toll at 20. No deaths were reported Saturday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arab-owned Palestine Press Service said two Arabs were wound- ed when troops fired to disperse pro- testers near Bethlehem in the West Bank.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Gaza Strip, the scene of much of the recent violence, Arab<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Jabaliya refugee camp out-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; side Gaza City, soldiers used tear gas to disperse protesters who threw stones and raised the flag of the out- lawed Palestine Liberation Organi- zation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near the West Bank city of Nablus, the army imposed a curfew on the Balata and Askar refugee camps after protest demonstrations in both areas, an army spokesman said. Troops used tear gas to disperse the protesters, he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palestinian youths attacked and vandalized three Israeli banks in the Jerusalem area, police said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the worst incident, about 40 youths smashed the glass storefront of Barclay’s Israel Discount Bank with rocks, tore apart the bank’s neon sign, then charged inside, smashing partitions and destroying equipment, witnesses said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teen-agers hurled rocks at a po- lice car, smashing the windshield and slightly injuring two officers, po- lice spokesman Alex Lapidoth said. He said a third officer was hit in the stomach outside the Damascus Gate of the walled Old City, and a fourth was slightly hurt in another incident.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the Arab village of Jabel Mukabar on the outskirts of Jerusalem, hundreds of villagers ransacked an Israeli restaurant, La- pidoth said. The villagers tore down the outer fence, smashed windows with rocks, exploded gas balloons in- side and set fire to part of the res- taurant before retreating.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arab witnesses said police later entered Jabel Mukabar, broke into a girls’ school, and arrested a head- mistress there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youths hurled a firebomb at an Is- raeli police station in the Azariya section of east Jerusalem, police said. No damage or injuries were caused.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tel Aviv, about 3,000 Israelis demonstrated against government policy in the occupied territories.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar rally took place in the Israeli Arab town of Nazareth, Isra- el radio said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“These disturbances have been the worst in at least a decade,” said Eli- as Zananiri, managing editor of the Palestinian English-language week- ly Al-Awdah.  |
