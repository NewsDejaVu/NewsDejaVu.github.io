(AP)—The main office build: ling of the Swift & Co. pack- ing plant here was shattered by an explosion at 11:45 a. m. (CST) today and a high city official estimated at least 25 persons were dead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter W. Lindgren, super- intendent of public safety for the city made the preliminary estimate of “at least 25 dead.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lindgren called it “prob- ably the worst disaster in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sioux City history.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lindgren said firemen and vol- unteers had donned gas masks to   go into the debris-choked basement wnere cries of the injured could be heard.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates of the number of in- jured ran as high as 200.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al Wright, city sales manager for   Swift who was in the company res- taurant in one corner of the 5-story brick office building at the time of the explosion, said:   “There was a big puff. That’s all I know.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The south side of the office build-  ‘Ing was demolished and early re- ports said the greatest force of the explosion seemed to come on the first floor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter Krebs, a spokesman for the firm, said “There is no telling how many may be dead or injured.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krebs said a natural gas leak may have caused the explosion. The gas is used in several departments, he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All emergency equipment and units, including the National Guard companies and the Naval Reserve Were sent to the scene.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acting Desk Sergeant Howard Hensen of the Sioux City police, gave this report:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Everything the city’s got has   been sent down there. All the am- bulances in town, all the doctors available, the coroner, the Naval Reserve unit and the National Guard,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We understand there are around 200 injured and some dead, but Jon’ know how many.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They've called for gas masks, We've sent those on hand here in fhe department and the Naval Re- serve and National Guard are send- ing some down, I understand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This switchboard has been flood- sd with calls from frantic relatives of the workers.  |
