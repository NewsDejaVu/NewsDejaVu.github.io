| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its towering white steeple and red-brick facade to its Sunday services filled with rousing gospel hymns and evangelistic sermons First Baptist Church of Alexandria Virginia bears many of the classic hallmarks of a Southern Baptist church. On a recent Sunday its pastor for women and children Kim Eskridge urged members to invite friends and neighbors to an upcoming vacation Bible school — a perennial Baptist activity — to help “reach families in the community with the gospel.” ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/religion-southern-baptists-women-pastors-saddleback-3b40fd925377a9e3aa2ecb4a4072a4a6)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a turbulent see-saw debate the Methodist church has approved women to join the ranks of the official clergy of America’s largest Protestant denomination. This decision marks the climax of years of contention within the church over the fitness of women to serve full-fledged pastoral posts. Dr. Georgia Harkness a theological professor from Berkeley California who had been in the forefront of the struggle for equal clerical status for women commented on the decision. The final approval was a move by Rev. Dr. Zach T. Johnson president of Asbury College Wilmore Kentucky that put women on par with men in filling the church’s 40000 pulpits. The measure that was approved included married women as well. However there was opposition led by Rev. J. Dewey Muir of Jacksonville Illinois who argued that while women make excellent preachers many churches dont want them and putting them on the regular roster of ministers would create a serious problem of administration. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (AP) — They are called zombies companies so laden with debt that they are just stumbling by on the brink of survival barely able to pay even the interest on their loans and often just a bad business hit away from dying off for good. An Associated Press analysis found their numbers have soared to nearly 7000 publicly traded companies around the world — 2000 in the United States alone — whiplashed by years of piling up cheap debt followed by stubborn inflation that has pushed borrowing ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/zombie-business-corporate-debt-investing-interest-borrowing-52bd9ebbe1dd98983d39fe7d14e3c7fd)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LONDON (AP) — Like New York London is in deep financial trouble. There is talk of bankruptcy but authorities say they are confident it wont happen here. London’s woes are strikingly similar to those now strapping the administration of Mayor Abraham D. Beame in New York. But London has physical assets to fall back on in a pinch and New York doesn’t. Among London’s woes: London’s debt was $4.6 billion at the end of March. It may be difficult to borrow more. An attempt in April to float a $162 million bond issue failed. Underwriters could not place 90 per cent of the bonds. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAPS and Lykos combined the drug — better known by its street name ecstasy — with psychotherapy adding complexity to the design of an already challenging trial. Investigators didn’t collect certain lab tests or data on the potential for abuse that the FDA specifically requested. And the push has been dogged by a perception that MAPS’s evangelism for psychedelics has seeped into Lykos’s work of scientifically proving the therapy’s benefits along with allegations of misconduct in clinical trial ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://washingtonpost.com/business/2024/06/08/psychedelic-drugs-mdma-fda-therapy/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ST. LOUIS (AP) — LSD the potentially dangerous drug may have accidentally uncovered a cause of considerable mental illness—the inability to express warmth toward one’s fellow man—a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist says. Dr. M. Robert Wilson Jr. said studies of a group of emotionally-ill adolescents who were given the drug during treatment had revealed a common underlying emotional effect. He told a seminar for science writers Tuesday that the common theme was expressed by one of the patients who said that during his LSD “trip” he suddenly “felt free to be compassionate and warm towards my fellow man.” Evidence from the study he said indicates that at least some emotionally-disturbed persons need “freedom to be warm or close” to another person or perhaps even to express suppressed warmth for an experience they are undergoing such as attending college. “I therefore think” said Wilson “that the inability to express one’s warm feelings probably underlies many psychiatric situations.” He said that some of the patients in the study had been drop-outs from college but that after their LSD experience they returned. Wilson spoke at a seminar co-sponsored by the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing and by Washington University. The doctor stressed that LSD has potential psychological and physiological hazards and he made clear he was not condoning its use by anyone except under controlled medical observation. |
