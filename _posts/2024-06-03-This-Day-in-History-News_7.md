| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Former President Donald Trumps historic criminal hush money trial will reach a critical peak on Tuesday when the prosecution and defense will present their closing arguments to the jury. Each side will weave together five weeks of evidence and testimony to make a case for the first-ever conviction or acquittal of a former U.S. president. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in order to conceal or commit another crime. Prosecutors argue Trump falsified records tied to rei ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/28/historic-trump-criminal-trial-reaches-critical-day-closing-arguments/73832451007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — The prosecutor in the John Connally bribery trial said today the former Treasury secretary should be convicted because his chief accuser has been corroborated ‘on virtually every conceivable point’’ where corroboration is possible. Asst. Special Prosecutor Frank Tuerkheimer told the jury ‘The testimony of Mr. (Jake) Jacobsen should be believed by you.”’ “The defense in this case is not a credible defense”’ Tuerkheimer declared. On Tuesday Connally conceded that some of his testimony conflicts with earlier statements he has made. Connally was the final witness in his own defense denying that he took two alleged $5000 payoffs from a milk producers’ co-op for helping persuade the Nixon administration to raise milk prices in 1971 Chief U.S. District Court Judge George L. Hart gave each side a maximum of two hours and 15 minutes to present their closing arguments to the jury today. He said his own instructions would take another hour. Assistant Special Prosecutor Frank M. Tuerkheimer spent more than two hours Tuesday attacking Connally’s denials. He forced him to admit a number of contradictions between the story he first told to investigators and the story he told the jury: —On Nov. 14 1973 Connally denied to a grand jury that he had spoken more than once in the preceding three or four weeks to Jake Jacobsen the dairy co-op lawyer who is now his chief accuser. Connally now concedes there were two meetings in that time. Connally said he gave a wrong answer before because he misunderstood the question. —The following April Connally told the grand jury about the meeting he had omitted mentioning before. But he said it was in the afternoon and now he says it must have been in the morning. Connally said he simply was mistaken. —Another time Connally said he had no way to fix the exact date of a meeting with Jacobsen which he now says took place June 25 1971. ‘Frankly our records were better than I thought they were” Connally explained. “I was just wrong.”’ Tuerkheimer hammered away at Connally’s account of a key meeting with Jacobsen Oct. 29 1973. That’s the date Jacobsen says he flew to Connally’s Houston law office and got $10000 in cash stuffed into a cigar box to use in covering up the alleged bribes. Connally says what actually took place was that he asked Jacobsen to investigate a bank charter application. |

| Louisiana Law Will Criminalize Approaching Police Under Certain Circumstances | Police Rally Calls For Tougher Laws |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BATON ROUGE La. (AP) — Critics of a new Louisiana law which makes it a crime to approach within 25 feet (7.6 meters) of a police officer under certain circumstances fear that the measure could hinder the public’s ability to film officers — a tool that has increasingly been used to hold police accountable. Under the law anyone who is convicted of “knowingly or intentionally” approaching an officer who is “lawfully engaged in the execution of his official duties” and after being ordered to ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/police-distance-law-louisiana-85f269d421b03a173bfbd4b98e95a018)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON - Thousands of policemen jammed the Capitol Wednesday in a demonstration for stiffer laws against attacks on police. The rally was called by the Fraternal Order of Police to show the people of this country we are fed up John J. Harrington national president told some 3500 officers and Congress members on the Capitol steps. The policemen came here from throughout the country. The thin line between civilization and the jungle—which is us policemen—is being shot to hell and something has to be done about it Harrington said. Harrington on leave from the Philadelphia Police Department said It’s time the people of this country face up to it there is a revolution taking place. He called for passage of legislation making it a federal crime to cross state lines to attack a policeman and providing the death penalty or life imprisonment for killing a policeman or fireman. In his rally speech and in earlier testimony before a House subcommittee Harrington criticized the Justice Department the Supreme Court liberal papers like the Washington Post the New York Times and the St. Louis Dispatch and many of the great TV chains. He also assailed moderate Negro leaders who have been taken in by charges against police. And he criticized Arthur Goldberg Democratic candidate for governor of New York for comments he said Goldberg made in connection with the killing of two Black Panthers last December in a Chicago police raid. If he has any concern for the policemen who are being killed by militants almost every day I have failed to read about it Harrington said. Testifying before the House subcommittee investigating the Black Panthers Harrington said when he wrote Attorney General John N. Mitchell about alleged Panther violations I got a mild reply from somebody down the line saying that an investigation was being held. |

| Violent Polarized Mexico Chooses Between 2 Women For President | Lausche Johnson Out As President Candidates |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico goes into Sunday’s election deeply divided: friends and relatives no longer talk politics for fear of worsening unbridgeable divides while drug cartels have split the country into a patchwork quilt of warring fiefdoms. The atmosphere is literally heating up amid a wave of unusual heat drought pollution and political violence. It’s unclear whether Mexico’s next president will be able to rein in the underlying violence and polarization.

This will not disappoint either of them. They are favorite son candidates technically. Actually what each seeks to do is to control his state’s delegation to the Democratic National Convention. They are Ohio’s Gov. Frank J. Lausche and Texas’ Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson. There never was much chance for Lausche anyway a fact of which that smart politician is fully aware. Lausche is in the dog house of the nation’s union leadership. His five-time record in being elected governor of Ohio suggests the rank and file of labor may feel more kindly than the union leaders toward Lausche. However that may be organized labor could and almost surely would block any effort to nominate Lausche. The men who rule the unions and control their large political funds exercise great power in Democratic national conventions. That should be enough to stop Lausche. Besides he confessed publicly some weeks ago what most political writers long had suspected; Lausche had voted for Sen. Robert A. Taft in 1950 and against the Democratic senatorial candidate Joseph Ferguson. Lausche laid his 1958 presidential candidacy away for good in Cincinnati this week. He told a news questioner that President Eisenhowers veto of the farm bill was right and proper. He would have compromised everything noble he has stood for all his life if he had signed that bill which was a bad bill said Lausche. That did it because the Democratic leadership is depending in very large part on the farm bill veto to win farm state votes for their candidates next November. The other big Democratic issue as of now is Mr. Eisenhowers health. The Democratic organization tabs him as a part-time president almost a play boy who has shucked off to subordinates vital responsibilities which should be his. That may or may not prove to be a controlling issue in this presidential campaign but the Democratic National Committee is pushing it hard. That is where Johnson fades from the 1956 presidential picture. As does Lausche in Ohio so does Johnson in Texas stand as a favorite son Democratic candidate. There is one difference. Lausche is sure of the Ohio delegation to the Democratic National Convention. Johnson is opposed by Gov. Allan Shivers who led the Texas bolt to Mr. Eisenhower in 1952. Johnson probably is aware that he has small chance of being nominated in 1956. Johnson suffered a heart attack last year about two months before Mr. Eisenhower was stricken. The senator is back on the job now as Democratic leader and he is working hard. The issue of Mr. Eisenhowers health however quickly would cease to be an issue if the Democrats nominated Johnson whose manner of living also must be controlled by the circumstances of his health. |

| Attacks On Justice System Could Be Useful To Autocrats Like Putin | Clementis Admits Guilt In Red Purge Trial |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his historic guilty verdict in his hush money case Donald Trump attacked the U.S. criminal justice system making unfounded claims of a “rigged” trial that echoed remarks from the Kremlin. “If they can do this to me they can do this to anyone” Trump said Friday speaking from his namesake tower in New York on Friday. Thousands of miles away Russian President Vladimir Putin was probably “rubbing his hands with glee” said Fiona Hill a former senior White House national security adviser. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/russia-trump-putin-us-election-2828902db670e00af3b1ac871938b96e)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIENNA Austria - Former Foreign Minister Vlado Clementis confessed in Prague Friday to a long series of sins against Stalin. The Czechoslovak Communist purge trial of 14 alleged renegades from Stalinism turned into a violent attack on world Jewry. The Communist prosecution suddenly produced a long-missing Israeli leftist held in Prague for a year as a witness against one of the chief defendants former Vice Premier and Party Secretary Rudolf Slansky. Slansky recited his own crimes Thursday for more than 3.5 hours in what one Western observer here called a push-button confession. Details of the Czech governments indictment broadcast by Prague quoted Clementis as linking Slansky to John Foster Dulles just named the next U.S. Secretary of State by President-elect Eisenhower. Clementis was said to have reported a conspiracy involving Slansky Dulles and world Jewry against the interests of Red Czechoslovakia. Bedrich Geminder one-time power behind the scenes in Czechoslovak Communism also recited a confession saying he plotted with Zionists and worked with Slansky to overthrow the government of President Klement Gottwald and re-established capitalism. One of the highlights of the days proceedings was the sudden appearance on the witness stand of Mordecai Oren long-missing member of the extreme leftist Mapam Party of Israel. He had gone to Czechoslovakia in 1951 at the invitation of the Communists and was held incommunicado. This was about the time of the arrest of Slansky. Evidently he had been coached as a star witness against the 14 defendants 11 of whom are Jews. Much of the confessions of Geminder Clementis and Slansky has concerned alleged plotting with Jews and Titoists. The 14000-word list of charges against Slansky once a Moscow favorite and the other defendants called Dulles a notorious spy and said he plotted to help wealthy Jewish families smuggle property out of Czechoslovakia. Among others it named the Peetschel family Sudeten bankers who are now in the West. |

Network chief Robert E. Kintner made the disclosure to House investigators as he recommended that Congress make it a federal crime to participate knowingly in the rigging of TV contest programs. Chairman Oren Harris (D-Ark.) said later the proposal deserves consideration by the committee. Kintner also announced that NBC planned to create a special investigating unit to police its programs for the purpose of “detecting rooting out and preventing deception.” Kintner’s reference to what he called an apparently illegal “kickback” system on “Treasure Hunt” was the first disclosure of any irregularity on that program which is still on the air. He said NBC’s own agent had uncovered the operation and had turned over evidence on it to the New York District Attorney’s office. Kintner’s testimony brought to a near climax the House Commerce Subcommittees investigation of the TV quiz scandal. It will wind up its hearings today with testimony from Dr. Frank Stanton president of Columbia Broadcasting System. Dan Murray of Jantone Enterprises Inc owner of “Treasure Hunt” said the two discharged employees worked as ‘warm-up men who were supposed to loosen up the audience before “Treasure Hunt” went on the air. Kintner told the congressional group that NBC had “never been a party to quiz show rigging” most of which was carried out by program producing firms. The network he said was just as much a victim as the public. Rep. John B. Bennett (R-Mich.) told Kintner “it appeared to him that NBC was something less than diligent in trying to get to the bottom of these rigged shows particularly ‘21!’ He said NBC now requires contract guarantees from producers as to the honesty of programs they stage for the network. |

The former South Carolina governor and former Republican presidential candidate was in Israel over the Memorial Day weekend visiting sites of the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that killed around 1200 people and led to over 240 being taken hostage.

George McGovern has vowed to force the moral issue of war upon the American conscience and if he wins the White House to end “this murderous bombing” within five minutes of his inauguration. He said he did not expect the normal campaign applause for his account of casualties and of “the most incredible and murderous bombardment in all the history of mankind.” The Democratic presidential nominee invoked the war issue from a platform President Nixon is to occupy tonight. It was a solemn windup to a campaign Tuesday that had featured the whooping politics of Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey bidding for Democratic solidarity at the side of the man who beat him for the presidential nomination. “Im going to do everything within my power between now and Nov. 7 to force the American people to examine the serious moral questions that are confronting us because of this barbaric behavior that has been going on in Indochina” McGovern told about 1000 people at a $250-a-plate fundraising dinner Tuesday night. In the same Century Plaza Hotel ballroom tonight Nixon is to address a $1000-a-ticket Republican campaign dinner. McGovern drew applause with his pledges to end the war and gain freedom for American prisoners. But when one tentative round of applause rippled through the ballroom after he spoke of civilian casualties McGovern said: “I know these things are hard to clap about and I don’t expect applause on descriptions of that kind.” After a 14-hour day of vote-hunting in California the state he said is his top-priority target in the presidential campaign McGovern spent the night flying back to Washington ending an 11-state campaign swing. His final speech was in stark contrast to the exuberance of his rallies with Humphrey at his side. Humphrey told a labor rally: “What this campaign needs is a good dose of believing of emotion of enthusiasm of spirit of optimism Were never going to win anything if we go around with a hang-dog look |
