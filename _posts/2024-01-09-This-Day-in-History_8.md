| Hundreds Of Convictions But Major Mystery Still Unsolved 3 Years After Jan. 6... | Officials Hunt Radicals In Wall Street Bombing |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of far-right extremist groups. Former police officers. An Olympic gold medalist swimmer. And active duty U.S. Marines. They are among the hundreds of people who have been convicted in the massive prosecution of the Jan 6 2021 riot in the three years since the stunned nation watched the U.S. Capitol attack unfold on live TV. Washington’s federal courthouse remains flooded with trials guilty plea hearings and sentencings stemming from what has become the largest crim ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/capitol-riot-jan-6-criminal-cases-anniversary-bf436efe760751b1356f937e55bedaa5)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convinced that the explosion which snuffed out the lives of 85 persons and injured nearly 300 others in Wall Street Thursday noon was deliberately planned by radicals officials of the Department of Justice headed by Atty. Gen. Palmer today spread a dragnet over the country to trap the originators. Spurred on by rewards aggregating $20500 offered by the city and an accident insurance company police ex-service men and private citizens lent their efforts to the federal agents in ferreting out clues. Department of Justice officials were certain that the disaster was not the result of one person’s inspiration or eccentricity but that it was premeditated and fiendish act bent on defying the government. This opinion was based on the finding of radical literature in post office boxes near the scene of the tragedy soon after it occurred. Very little could be done to trace the authors of this literature or to ascertain whether a general radical movement was contemplated until definite persons can be found who were responsible for Thursdays disaster it was said. Confidence that the “American anarchist fighters” who are believed to have caused the disastrous bomb explosion in Wall Street Thursday would be brought to justice was expressed today by William J. Flynn chief of the bureau of investigation of the Department of Justice. Sees Anarchist Plot Chief Flynn said he was certain from the similarity of circulars found in a mail box near Wall Street at the time of the explosion to those found at the scene of bomb explosions in June 1919 that the same crowd of terrorists was responsible for both outrages. “We had solved the mysteries of last year’s bombs but were frustrated in bringing the criminals to justice when Alfredo Salesedo whom we were detaining jumped from a fourteenth story window and committed suicide” said Flynn. “That tipped our hand and the crowd got safely out of the country before we could nab them. “Now we have much more to go on at the start. The similarity of the circulars makes available all our knowledge of the gang who committed the outrages last year. Most of this information has never been made public and it would not be wise to reveal it now. Torn bits of pink paper were the only evidence we had last vent. Now we have whole circulars dropped into a mail box presumably by the man who set off the bomb half an hour after a letter carrier had emptied the box. In addition there are the horse and the broken bits of the wagon on which the bomb was placed” Primary importance in today’s search was attached to finding the driver of the dilapidated rusty red wagon the fragments of which were found nearest the crater of the detonation. Officials believe apprehension of the authors of the tragedy virtually hinges on this discovery. Says Driver Is Known Col. William Mend chief clerk for J.P. Morgan and Company declared the man who shod the horse that drew the death wagon had been found and that he was reasonably sure of the owner’s identity. Department of Justice officials early today had neither confirmed nor denied this report but Atty. Gen. Palmer said an attempt was made to trace the animal’s owner. “A blacksmith called at police headquarters this morning and told Captain Coughlin he had shod a strange horse last Tuesday and thought he would be able to recognize the shoes if he inspected them. It was arranged for him to look at the shoes later in the day. Particular significance was attached to the farrier’s statement that he had shod the strange horse Tuesday two days before the explosion as experts examining the new shoes estimated they had been on only 48 hours. Many of the injured were said to be still in a serious condition. Scores will be maimed for life it was said. |

| Iran Says At Least 73 People Killed 170 Wounded In Blasts At Ceremony Honoring Soleimani | Martial Law In Jerusalem After Blast Kills Hundred |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DUBAI United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two bombs exploded and killed at least 84 people at a commemoration for a prominent Iranian general slain by the U.S. in a 2020 drone strike Iranian officials said as the Middle East remains on edge over Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza. No one immediately claimed responsibility for what appeared to be the deadliest militant attack to target Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution.

The casualty toll in the bombing of the King David stood at 54 persons killed 52 missing 53 wounded seriously and about 150 injured less dangerously. The victims of the blast which ripped off a whole corner of the King David destroying about 25 rooms on five floors which housed military and administrative offices numbered some of the highest officials in the country. An ironclad curfew was imposed on Palestine after the bombing. An official announcement said it was being lifted today. The Jewish area was kept under the most rigid control. Details of the measures verging on martial law which the British expected to enforce were not disclosed immediately. During the night while rescue squads were digging mangled bodies out from under chunks of concrete and rubble armed British soldiers were smashing through iron shutters into shops along the Jaffa Road Jerusalem’s principal Jewish business center. Official quarters believed that the King David blast was engineered by the so-called stern gang with a strong possibility of participation by the Irgun Zvai Leumi militant Jewish underground organization. They said they had found no evidence so far that Hagana the third of the clandestine Jewish groups was implicated. The Jewish agency whose leaders and headquarters were seized by the British on June 29 issued a statement expressing its horror. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last week alone an Israeli airstrike has killed a Hezbollah commander in Lebanon Hezbollah struck a sensitive Israeli base with rockets and Israel killed a senior Hamas militant with an airstrike in Beirut.

A Syrian army communique said more than 150 Syrian and Israeli jets clashed in major battles over eastern Lebanon\s Bekaa Valley. It said 10 Israeli F-15s and F-16s and five Syrian MiGs were shot down. The Israeli command did not confirm that such a large aerial clash occurred. It said only that two Syrian aircraft a MiG and a helicopter were downed One unconfirmed Lebanese report said the Israeli jets attacked Syrian anti- aircraft missile sites in the Bekaa which lies between Beirut anti the Syrian capital of Damascus. On the ground the Syrians reported clashes with the Israelis in the highlands east of Beirut and with Israeli units try- ing to push into the Bekaa from the south. The Syrian command said its forces in- flicted heavy Israeli casualties knocked out 23 Israeli tanks and shot down two planes in several clashes The Israelis acknowledged battles with the Syrians but gave few details. The Israeli military command reported meanwhile that its troops had captured the coastal town of Damour just 10 miles south of Beirut. Syrian reinforcements were pouring into Lebanon. Informed sources in Damascus said the number of Syrian troops in Lebanon had been more than doubled to 65000. Reports on the number of Israeli troops in Lebanon range from 20000 to 60000. The Syrians said they had stopped the northernmost units of Israel\s invasion force as they tried to cut the Beirut- Damascus highway in the hills 12 miles east of the Lebanese capital. Israeli armored units were airlifted in- to the area Tuesday in a lightning thrust aimed at closing the Israeli vise on the Lebanese capital and other Palestinian strongholds Twenty-five miles to the south the Israelis launched a two-pronged push northward toward eastern Lebanon\s Syrian-controlied Bekaa Valley behind massive air and artillery bombardment the Syrian command said. Palestinian guerrillas had reportedly moved into the Bekaa after fleeing the Israeli invasion earlier this week. The Syrians claimed to have halted the two-pronged southern offensive mounted from the Israeli-captured town of Hasbaya 10 miles north of the Israeli border. The private ‘Voice of Lebanon’’ radio said Israeli jets attcked Syrian SAM-6 anti-aircraft missile sites in the Bekaa Valley. This eae Was not otherwise verified. Informed sources in the Syrian capital of Damascus who asked not to iden- tified claimed Syrian troops at Beirut\s international airport foiled an Israeli at- tempt to land airborne troops in the air- port area on the capital\s southern ap- proaches. Four Israeli warships meanwhile shelled the beaches of southern Beirut’s Ouzai neighborhood Lebanon\s state radio said. The 10-minute bombardment caused no casualties or damage it said. Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat appealed from his secret command bunker in west Beirut for collective Arab intervention to keep Israel from invading the Lebanese capital |

| Simple Ways To Give Your Brain A Real Rest | Are We Going Nuts? |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you think about getting rest which of these situations comes to mind? A. Enjoying a good night’s sleep B. Taking a midday nap C. Reclining on the sofa to watch mindless television While these restful moments all have their place in daily life it’s a common misconception to view rest as an entirely passive experience. True rest say experts is not just about being sedentary or in the prone position — it’s also about giving your brain the restorative breaks it needs to function at an opt ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/01/05/brain-rest-breaks-vacation-benefits/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in the United States may be going at too fast a pace to make their sanity certain. Dr. John W. Thompson of Harvard University told the American Association for the Advancement of Science today that both physical and mental work appear to be wearing down the nerves and reflexes of human beings who work too hard in any activity. Fatigue of the mind and nerve cells is apparently one of the major causes of mental illness which keeps about one out of every ten persons in the country under medical and institutional care he declared. Dr. Thompson an assistant in the fatigue laboratory at Harvard declared that tiredness is one of the cardinal signs of a number of illnesses such as tuberculosis thyroid gland trouble and anemia. In addressing the association\s symposium on mental hygiene he declared that while physical work makes nerves unable to work properly mental work causes the entire body to get out of control and therefore makes it impossible for the nerves to carry impulses from the brain to the muscles The two processes are apparently identical in the results which they cause. Any change in the nature of nerve reflexes will alter the design of the total response and therefore the fatigue resulting either from the lack of sleep or exhausting muscular activity produces changes in the cells of the nervous system which cannot be detected in any way except by the response of the person affected he declared. During intense periods of mental work there appear periods during which there is a complete failure of nerve response as a result of fatigue he declared. In a recent experiment at the University of Chicago in which students were kept awake for two days by violent stimulation they appeared to go partially crazy and kicked and bit each other on the slightest provocation. |

I asked the phone company to clear the lines and they had repair men here several times. The president and vice president of the company came. No—I didn’t ask to see their credentials. I took their word for who they were. The repair men failed to clear the lines but they changed the numbers. They were tapped more than ever. I could hear clicks. The clicks stopped when the ad appeared. |

| What Is A Leap Year? Breaking Down The Science And History Behind The Ancient Phenomenon | Leap Week At Indiana Central College |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year has 365 days. Well almost. Every four years (give or take) our calendars receive an additional day. Known as leap day Feb. 29 is tacked on and becomes the last day of the shortest month of the year. And beyond giving people an extra day to reach their goals there is some science as to why we have leap days. So as you\re making leap day plans for this year here\s a quick primer on how it came to be. What is leap day? A leap day takes place during a leap year which is a year ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/01/06/what-is-a-leap-year/72108115007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Leap Week at Indiana Central College and the co-eds are paving the bills on dates. The men naturally like it. And so believe it or not do the girls. Leap-year woo-pitching is hitting a feverish pace on the campus in the seven days ending with St. Valentine’s Day. No holds are barred but the YMCA and YWCA have agreed on these rules: (1) Any co-ed may ask any man for a date—and unless he’s already taken up she gets one (2) She pays for everything whether cokes at the corner drugstore or dinner and a show downtown. Last night—opening night—experienced campus observers figured there were seventy-five dates. The formal program begins with a school party tonight and ends with the traditional sweethearts’ banquet Wednesday. Indiana Central is a United Brethren College with some 380 students—men and women in about equal numbers Leaders in campus politics practiced in sounding out sentiment say the whole 380 think leap week great. It’s something completely different remarked Dwight Smith of Miamisburg OH twenty-one senior and president of Mens Hall. Everybody has a lot of fun out of it. He conceded that some men who got bids from perennial wallflowers werent too happy. But added hastily they take it all in fun. Henrietta Rider twenty-one of Westfield IL petite brunette Chairman of the YWCA social committee said she thought the idea good too. One reason she admitted might be that it was her idea in the first place. We girls like it she said. because it gives us a chance to show the men what a real gentleman is supposed to be like. Smith said he didn’t have a date last night Miss Rider said she had one for every night of the week. |
