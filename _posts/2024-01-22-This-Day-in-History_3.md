| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald Trump’s iron grip on the Republican Party has been clear since the day he announced he would make another run for the White House 14 months ago. It can be seen in the party’s ideological shift even further to the right on cultural issues and especially on immigration policy. Iowa Republicans were a clear reflection of that on Monday night delivering the former president an emphatic victory.

Edward Kennedy. Carter who got a big hug from New Jersey Gov. Brendan Byrne at nearby Newark Airport will be nominated tonight in Madison Square Garden in a replay of 1976. Meantime he will hold strategy sessions in his downtown Manhattan Sheraton Centre suite and perhaps seek a quick peace with Kennedy to dim his dismal showing behind Republican Ronald Reagan in political polls. Carter took a helicopter from the airport to downtown Manhattan for morning receptions with supporters and party officials. But there was no in- dication of a face-to-face meeting with Kennedy — or even if Kennedy will appear on the podium with Carter Thursday night when Carter makes his acceptance speech. “I can win much better with him” Carter said Tuesday when asked if he could defeat Reagan Nov. 4 without Kennedy’s support. “I hope I’ll have his support but that’s a decision for him to make.” In his first political maneuver of the day the president flew into nearby Newark airport from Washington so he could get a warm greeting from Byrne a strong Carter supporter. The president thus avoided a direct welcome from New York Gov. Hugh Carey who pushed a bitter and un- successful battle to allow Carters convention delegates to vote for whom they pleased. Carter his wife Rosalynn and daughter Amy 12 flew to Newark aboard Air Force One from Washington after the president spent a week in seclusion at Camp David Md. After the receptions at the Sheraton Centre Carter arranged to see a parade of visiting politicians in his suite. Party unity apparently was much on the president’s mind as he returned to the White House Tuesday from Camp David. Asked about Kennedy the president told reporters: “T hope Ill have his support but that’s a decision for him to make. It certainly would be beneficial for me to have his full support in the campaign. We had very good talk last night and I was very pleased with what he said.” Kennedy telephoned Carter Monday night to announce he was dropping his long fight for the nomination. The Massachusetts senator congratulated Carter in a Tuesday night speech to the convention — but left his full support an open question. Thursday afternoon Carter will go to the Plaza Hotel to speak at a congressional campaign luncheon. In keeping with tradition he will not go to Madison Square Garden tonight but will watch the vote on television. Carter has spent many hours of work on the acceptance speech he will deliver at the convention Thursday evening with emphasis on the need to end party divisiveness. The president plans to return to Camp David Friday after he delivers a pep talk to a Democratic National Committee meeting. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Carolyn: My best friend from high school and college and I drifted apart as young adults. As I moved on and formed new friendships I realized just how toxic this former friend was for me. She could be so mean and belittling. I remember so many times when I felt so bad about myself because of something she did or said to me. My current friend group is supportive kind and loving to one another. I came to realize what it’s like to have deep relationships with friends who truly care and would ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/01/19/carolyn-hax-toxic-friend-rekindle/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramors of Reconciliation Dissipat- ed by Harry’s Return to Gay White Way. Slayer of Stanford White Says He’s Willing to Help Erstwhile Wiie Bat Will Never Retu\n to Her. : NEW YORK Jan. 9.—Harry kK. Thaw\s sudden disappearance from Pittsburgh has turned out to oe much the opposite of » secret trip to the bedside of his former wife Evelyn Nesbit in Chicago. His mission was to taste once more the gay life of Gotham’s night clubs. It was learned that Thaw al- ready hag spent two days amoug his old haunts on Broadway and that during a visit to Texas Guin- an’s 300 club he -was_ virtually mobbed by actresses. - His first act upon arriving in New York was to telephone Kitty Mulligan a dancer in “Jimmie” Kelly\s place. Madge Wilcox who shares the apartment told him Kitty was asleep and could not be disturbed. A half hour later a “messenger arrived ‘with a huge boquet of American beauty roses. An. accompanying envelcpe con- ‘tained $10 and a note addressed ““Miss Mulligan\s Girl Friend.” The note follows: _ “Please give these to her and please do. not. worry. Here\s $10 4% for you and the rest for a splendid breakfast right off. Then tell her to be ready at 244 and 345. She knows for he was able to go \to her grandmother\s in Allen- ‘town. Yours truly.” The note was not signed. When Thaw arrived at Kitty\s apartment he told her of his ex- wife\s attempt at suicide and that he was sorry for her and how he sarnestly hoped she would recov- er Thaw indulged in a\two hour tet-atete with Kitty but Jeft in a \rage because she got too many telephone calls while he was vis- iting her. -   Later he.went to a theater and there lost a handkerchief. He Said it was a woman’s handker- chief and spent more than an hour aided by the entire staff of the theater in a futile search for it. He reached Texas Guinan’s about 1.a.m. and was greeted up- Toariously by the crowd there. Francis Williams. a night club dancer did a Charleston for Thaw who viewed her performance with deépest gravity. ; Thaw declared reports that he would seek a reconciliation with his former wife. Evelyn Nebsit to be “pure moonshine.” “I shall always be ready to heip her with money and see that she gets on her feet again.’ Thaw said “but ta say that I’m going back t) the woman who wrecked my life— why ‘that\s all noneesnse.”- |

| Supreme Court Considers Chevron Principle In Major Case | Supreme Court Will Rule On Use Of Old Refuse Law |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court on Wednesday wrestled over whether to fiddle with - or even overturn - a 40-year-old precedent that has guided how federal agencies protect the environment workers consumers and more. How do we know where the line is? Justice Clarence Thomas asked in opening more than three and a half hours of debate over how much deference courts should give federal agencies when the law is unclear. While the cases before the court on Wednesday were brought by herring fisher ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/01/17/supreme-court-herring-fishermen-case/72254165007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court has agreed to rule on the government’s power to use a 19th century federal refuse law to bring criminal action against industrial polluters of the nation’s navigable waters. About 200 suits depend on the outcome of the case accepted Monday for review this spring. The government is seeking to overturn a decision by the U.S. Circuit Court in Philadelphia that limited the scope of the law. The Justice Department’s appeal complained that the lower court had stood the law on its head and emasculated what Congress had in mind in 1899 when it prohibited dumping of all refuse except common liquid sewage into navigable waters. The case concerns the conviction last year of the Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical Corp. for passing iron and aluminum solids and compounds into the Monongahela River. The firm was fined $10000. Last May however in a 2-1 ruling the Philadelphia court said the firm was being punished for not obtaining a permit when no broad permit system existed. A new trial was ordered. Since then the U.S. Circuit Court in Boston has read the law the way the government prefers in the case of a Manchester N.H. slaughtering plant convicted of polluting the Merrimack River. The Supreme Court evidently has decided to resolve the conflict in interpretations. In other decisions before beginning a three-week holiday recess the justices: Gave the government authority to check out the names of all contributors to a domestic organization allegedly linked to Irish insurgents. The vote was 6-3. Rejected an appeal by former Louisiana Atty. Gen. Jack P. F. Gremillion who was convicted of perjury to a federal grand jury investigating a bankrupt loan company. He faces three years in prison. |
