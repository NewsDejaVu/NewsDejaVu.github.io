| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (AP) — Rep. George Santos said he expects to be expelled from Congress following a scathing report by the House Ethics Committee that found substantial evidence of lawbreaking by the New York Republican.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a defiant speech Friday sprinkled with taunts and obscenities aimed at his congressional colleagues, Santos insisted he was “not going anywhere.” But he acknowledged that his time as a member of Congress, at least, may soon be coming to an end.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I know I’m going to get expelled when this expulsion resolution goes to the floor,” he said Friday night during a conversation on X Spaces. “I’ve done the math over and over, and it doesn’t look really good.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comments came one week after the Republican chairman of the House Ethics Committee, Michael Guest, introduced a resolution to expel Santos once the body returns from Thanksgiving break.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Santos has survived two expulsion votes, many of his colleagues who formerly opposed the effort now say they support it, citing t ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/george-santos-house-ethics-committee-bf33ec0df1997467617f5d19531a4b26](https://apnews.com/article/george-santos-house-ethics-committee-bf33ec0df1997467617f5d19531a4b26) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — Harrison A. Williams Jr., facing in- surmountable odds against his ex- pulsion from the Senate, has decided to resign, congressional sources said today.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One source, who asked not to be identified, said Williams had drafted a letter of resignation to be delivered later today to Vice President George Bush, in his constitutional role as president of the Senate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This source said Williams, a liberal New Jersey Democrat, planned to make an impassioned declaration in a floor speech of his innocence in the FBI’s undercover Abscam_in- vestigation, and then would leave the Capitol.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams’ chief defender, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, planned to disclose that Williams had written and delivered the resignation letter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sources say Williams, 62, had told colleagues privately that he intends to resign after waging a losing, seven-month battle to avoid ex- pulsion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There still was a slight possibility Williams might change his mind before the Senate votes on the ex- pulsion resolution. If the resolution is adopted, Williams would be the first senator to be expelled since the Civil War.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams was described as being distraught over his situation and that has accounted for his hesitation about his intentions, sources said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicly, the 23-year veteran of the Senate said Wednesday that he would continue to fight expulsion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could not be determined whether Williams would resign before the Senate votes on a proposal that he be censured, a lesser penalty that has<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been urged by those who argue that he was the victim of FBI and prosecutorial abuse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate had been expected to vote on censure Wednesday, but the vote was postponed and could come today.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the sponsor of the censure vote, Democratic Whip Alan Cran- ston, D-Calif., said it would fail. And Cranston that if Williams does not resign, it will be impossible for him to avoid expulsion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the censure vote, assuming it is taken, the Senate would turn its attention once again to the expulsion resolution recommended unanimously by the Senate Ethics Committee last summer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disclosure about William’s plans came as a chorus grew among Senate Democrats for Williams’ expulsion.  |
