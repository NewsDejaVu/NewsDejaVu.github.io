| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 538-Washington Post-Ipsos poll of potential Republican primary and caucus voters who watched Wednesday’s debate, hosted by NewsNation, finds 30 percent thought DeSantis “performed best,” followed by 23 percent who chose Haley. This is a turn in fortunes for Haley, as after the last debate, our poll found that 34 percent of debate watchers thought she performed best, compared with 23 percent who said DeSantis performed best.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate watchers are more unified, however, in who they think performed the worst in Wednesday’s debate, with 37 percent choosing tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and 31 percent picking former New Jersey governor Chris Christie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most candidates saw little movement after the debate in the share of GOP debate viewers who consider supporting them. DeSantis, Haley, Ramaswamy and Trump saw the share considering them move one percentage point or less, which is within the poll’s margin of error.

An Associated Press poll indicated that Reagan and Carter gained just about equally in the eyes of the registered voters who viewed the 90-minute confrontation — their first and last.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey also said that the television audience leaned Reagan’s way before the debate began. In the judgment of those viewers, Reagan did the better job as a debater ; 46 percent saw it that way, 34 percent said Carter did best.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But neither Reagan nor Carter carved significantly into the support of the other. The debate, it appeared, firmed opinions about the two candidates, but did not markedly change them. Their post-debate gains came largely among people who had been undecided, with a handful of registered voters who had sid- ed with independent John B. Anderson switching to one of the major party contenders.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson, campaigning in Philadelphia, said the debate created the perception that the contest is now a two-man affair, between Carter and Reagan. Anderson, who didn’t make the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cleveland debate team, has staked his third-man campaign against exactly that view. He said he would keep “‘trying very hard to remedy that,’’ and insisted that he isn’t out of the runn- ing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter was campaigning in Pittsburgh, Rochester, N.Y., Newark, then Philadelphia. Pennsylvania and New Jersey are on the list of big, tossup states, crucial to the outcome of next Tuesday’s election. Reagan will be working in both before the week is out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republican nominee went straight to Texas, another sw- ing state, to campaign in Houston, Ft. Worth and Dallas. Carter will be hunting Texas votes on Saturday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We'll whip the Republicans from the courthouse all the way to the White House,”’ the president said in Pittsburgh. Then he accused Reagan of misstatements in the Cleveland debate, con- centrating once again on nuclear weapons policy, which he call- ed “‘the most important single issue in this campaign. . .”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president quoted Reagan once again as saying last winter that the spread of nuclear weapons was not America’s business, and challenged his rival’s disavowal of that statement.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reagan said Tuesday night that an effort to halt nuclear pro- liferation would be a major part of his foreign policy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter contended Wednesday that Reagan’s position ‘has been that if Libya, a terrorist nation, or Iraq or other countries like Pakistan, South Africa, want to have an atomic bomb, it’s none of our business.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Last night he insinuated that he had not said this,’’ Carter said. “But I had my people look it up again this morning...”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said Reagan was quoted in the Feb. 1 New York Times as saying that if other nations develop nuclear weapons, ‘‘I just don’t think it’s any of our business...”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter added:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“For people who care about controlling terrorism, that is the ultimate terrorist threat ... and every American ought to stop and think what will happen to this world if we have no control over nuclear weapons between ourselves and the Soviet Union,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if we launch — as Gov. Reagan has proposed — an arms race and if we take the position it’s none of our business if terrorist nations have atomic weannnse ”’  |
