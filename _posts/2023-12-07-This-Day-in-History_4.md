| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 538-Washington Post-Ipsos poll of potential Republican primary and caucus voters who watched Wednesday’s debate, hosted by NewsNation, finds 30 percent thought DeSantis “performed best,” followed by 23 percent who chose Haley. This is a turn in fortunes for Haley, as after the last debate, our poll found that 34 percent of debate watchers thought she performed best, compared with 23 percent who said DeSantis performed best.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate watchers are more unified, however, in who they think performed the worst in Wednesday’s debate, with 37 percent choosing tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and 31 percent picking former New Jersey governor Chris Christie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most candidates saw little movement after the debate in the share of GOP debate viewers who consider supporting them. DeSantis, Haley, Ramaswamy and Trump saw the share considering them move one percentage point or less, which is within the poll’s margin of error. Christie is the only candidate who saw a significant jump in support fro ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/07/poll-republican-presidential-debate/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/07/poll-republican-presidential-debate/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By THE ASSOCTATED PRESS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sens. Hubert H. Humphrey (D- Minn) and John F. Kennedy (1D. Mass) met headon in a televi- sion debate last Wednesday night at Charleston, W. Va.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two rivals for the Demo. eratic presidential nomination produced no sparks, no fireworks. The tone was mild and unbitter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humphrey did take issue with a constant Kennedy refrain-—-that Humphrey has no chance to be nominated and a vote for him in West Virginia's May 10 primary is wasted,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked if he thought he had a chance, Humphrey said:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“TI most surely do.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added “No Democrat has this nomination tied up If you have 200 (convention) votes you're just as much alive politically as<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man with 500 votes.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate was televised over a state network, but was seen in some out-of-state cities<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vice President Richard M_ Nix on, unopposed for the Republican presidential nomination, had kind words in New York Wednesday for the man who bowed out of the race against him—Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nixon told a news conference Rockefeller has “tremendous sup- port throughout the country for national office among the Republi. cans.” But he begged off on any direct expression that he wants Rockefeller for his running mate and put it up to the governor. In Albany Rockefeller repeated that he won't accept the second place spot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been reports that Nixon would like to have Rocke- feller on the ticket. Nixon's state ment Wednesday was viewed in some quarters as an attempt to make sure no one would put the blame at his door if Rockefeller continues adamant about refusing the vice presidential nomination.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Footnotes on Tuesday's primar- jes:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District of Columbia: Complete unofficial returns in the presiden- tial popularity poll): Humphrey 7, 831, Sen. Wayne Morse (D-Ore) 5,866. The only non Humphrey del. egate candidate to win a conven. tion seat was a Morse delegate. Humphrey is assured of all nine D.C. convention votes because of a unit rule,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indiana: On nearly complete re- turns, Nixon's plurality over Ken nedy in the respective GOP and Democratic primaries Was more than 50,000 votes. Nixon had 400, 291 to Kennedy's 350,190, but the Democratic party outpolled the Republican total 433,957 to 418, 039. Leaders of both parties claimed sustenance and = cheer from the results.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alabama: States Rights candi- dates for presidential elector, pledged to bolt the Democratic party if it picks a nominee they disapprove, apparently held firm control over a portion of the state's votes in the electoral col- lege.
