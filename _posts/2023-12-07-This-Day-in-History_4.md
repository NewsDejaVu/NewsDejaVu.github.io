| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A judge in Texas is allowing a woman who is 20 weeks pregnant to get an abortion in a rare case of a pregnant woman seeking a court order for the procedure since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court last year. Keeping up with politics is easy with The 5-Minute Fix Newsletter, in your inbox weekdays. ArrowRight The case involves Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from the Dallas area, who asked the nonprofit Center for Reproductive Rights for legal help in obtaining an emergency abortion in Texas after she learned last week that her fetus had Trisomy 18, also called Edwards syndrome. The genetic condition is one “that cannot sustain life,” as Cox wrote in an op-ed on Wednesday in the Dallas Morning News.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cox’s doctor warned that carrying the pregnancy to term could jeopardize her health and future fertility, including uterine rupture and hysterectomy, according to the lawsuit filed on her behalf.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travis County District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble, an elected Democrat, said  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/07/texas-abortion-judge-ruling/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/07/texas-abortion-judge-ruling/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRENTON, N.J. (UPI) — A man who obtained a court order to stop his 19-year-old girlfriend from having an abortion was described as ‘‘deeply saddened and shocked’’ upon learning she had the operation and may sue for damages on behalf of the unborn child.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State Supreme Court Justice Robert Clifford, who issued the temporary restraining order, said Friday he was satisfied the young woman, Wendy Chasalow of Morristown, N.J.,; was not aware of the order when she had the operation in New York Thursday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The case is moot,” said Alvin Weiss, the Newark attorney representing the Trenton State College coed. ‘‘The family would like the case to be forgotten. The sooner this is forgotten the bet- ter.’’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a spokesman for John Rothenberger, 23, said his lawyers are considering filing a suit seeking damages on behalf of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the unborn infant, which Rothenberger says he fathered. Clifford had issued the in-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ke xk<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; junction Thursday barring the abortion until the full seven- member court could meet Monday to hear Rothenberger’s appeal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Chasalow, who was six weeks pregnant, was apparently aware of her boyfriend’s at- tempts as late as Wednesday to prevent the abortion. His first attempt to obtain an order against the abortion had been turned down by a lower court.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spokesman for Rother- berger said he just ‘‘wanted to be alone” after he learned of the abortion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Naturally he was deeply saddened and shocked by these turn of events. He considered it a death of a child, his own child.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rothenberger argued that he, as the father, should have a voice in whether the abortion should be allowed. His attorney, Richard Maggi, said he expected arguments in the case would revive the question of legal rights for unborn children.  |
