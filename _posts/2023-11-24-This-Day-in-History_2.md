Schmidt, direc- tor of the State Department of Public Welfare. :<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schmidt said he had studied the case personally and was con- curred in the board’s findings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the procedure for clemency, Babich may again ap- ply for parole in one year. Ba- bich personally appeared before the parole board at the prison Thursday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schmidt said Babich had made an “excellent inmate and a capable worker in office and 'messenger work and activities .in which he has participated.”   But, the welfare official said, (“in view of, the emotion raised {in his (Babich’s) community, his family might be subject to out- side tensions that would make it difficult for him to adjust to a normal family life.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Opposed Parole<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dist. Atty. William J. McCauley, Milwaukee, who prosecuted Babich, and Munici- pal Judge Herbert J. Steffes, who presided over his trial, had opposed the application for pa- role.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schmidt added “both Babich and his family will be better off if he remains in prison at this time.” Schmidt said he had re- ceived some 40 contacts—phone calls, letters and interviews — from individuals in the case, and all were opposed to the re- lease of Babich on parole.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parole board that recom- mended against freeing Babich is headed by Thomas C. Bourke, Madison. Other members are Bernett Odegard and Roland E. McCauley, both of Madison.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schmidt said two of the board members voted against parole and a third favored another re- view in 10 months. He did not specify how they lined up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeared Before Board<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babich, formerly of West Al. lis in Milwaukee County, ap- peared before the board Thurs- day as it held its regular Febru. ary meeting at the Wisconsin State Prison here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife, the former Kathleen Birmingham, 24, is -studying nursing and is scheduled to fin- ish her training in a year and a half. The couple has a child.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babich was convicted in 1948 of the slaying earlier the same year of Patricia Birmingham. 16, because she taunted him about her sister’s pregnancy. The girl’s body was found un. expectedly in a river as author. ities searched for the body of a possible suicide victim. The gir] had been shot to death.  |
