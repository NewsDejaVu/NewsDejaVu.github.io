Raccoons like the smell and taste of marshmallows, which resemble the chicken eggs they like to eat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share this article Share<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USDA, state and local officials also placed 18,000 vaccine packets in parks, along storm drains, around trees and bushes, and near walking paths in the woods in a five-mile radius. The oral rabies vaccine baits come in two-inch sachets similar to a ketchup packet and are coated with fishmeal to attract raccoons.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As they chew on it, they are bathing their mouth and tonsils with the vaccine, and that starts the immune reaction,” Chipman said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal officials have been trying to control the sp ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/11/26/rabies-kitten-omaha-raccoon/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/11/26/rabies-kitten-omaha-raccoon/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  CHICAGO Pp — Animal lover Irene Castle, onetime darling of the Broadway stage, today offered to let a mad dog bite her to save her four-footed friends from the pain and danger of a hypodermic needle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of Wlinois ordered ev- ery’ dog and cat in Chicago inoe- ulated against rabies. in an unpree- edented step to halt an epidemic of the disease that has killed one child and seen several mass at- tacks by slavering dogs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog pounds were filling up and officials said they may have to Start destroying strays in whole- sale lots to make room for new- comers,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Humane Society officials eall- ed for “calmness rather than hys- teria,’’ a farmer near Chicago tele- phoned the sheriff's office to re- port that he had shot both his dog and cat because of fear of rabies.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Castle, who is now Mrs. George Enzinger and operates the famous Orphans of the Storm ani- mal shelter at nearby Deerfield, lil., said “inoculations would par- alyze the hind legs of dogs.’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She offered to put up $5,000 and challenged, ‘no one can prove that a person bitten by a rabid dog ever died as a result.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“She would most certainly die,” said Chicago Health Board Presi-. dent Dr. Herman Bundesen.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, why don’t they let me do   it, then,” she answered. :<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her statements about rabies were not supported by medical opinion. It is considered one of the most virulent of diseases, is al-— ways fatal after incubation and is   accompanied by incredible suffer-   ing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inoculation order, which will undoubtedly be resisted by many pet owners, was likely to cost Chi- cagoans about one million dollars   at $3 a shot for an estimated 350,-— 100 dogs and 250,000 cats, some of   which have already received shots.  |
