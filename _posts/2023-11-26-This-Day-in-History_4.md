| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next year, the survival of democracy should be the central issue in American politics. To insist on this is to be a realist, not an alarmist. But making that case requires identifying two distinct threats. Need something to talk about? Text us for thought-provoking opinions that can break any awkward silence. ArrowRight The first is Donald Trump, who is already at the center of our national conversation. The second is the ongoing assault on voting rights, which rarely commands the airwaves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s start with the good news: It has become untenable to treat Trump as a normal presidential candidate, thanks to his own evermore radical rhetoric, starting with his pledges to use the Justice Department as a tool for revenge against political enemies. The result is a partial but welcome shift in journalistic coverage recognizing Trump’s journey into what the New York Times called “more fascist-sounding territory.” The Economist, no avatar of left-wing politics, received wide attention ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/26/voting-rights-eighth-circuit-democracy-trump/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/26/voting-rights-eighth-circuit-democracy-trump/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vew York, Oct. 28—(By The Asso- ‘ed Press)—-Declaring there “can be po compromise with reaction” an! easserting his position on several of the more important issues before poeple,” John W. Davis. demo- cartic eandidate for president, today issued the first of a series of state- ments for publication between now and November 4. .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mr. Davis’ attitude regarding a number of the policies he will seek to put into effect, if elected presi- dent, is set forth as follows: “The American people are entitled tu know the policies which I will seek ‘o put into effect if elected president of the United States.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Accordingly, on each day of the coming week I shall re-state suc- cinetly my position on each of the more imuortant issues before the neople.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberalism or Reaction?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supreme issue in this cam- raign is: “Shall the attitude of mind of the national administration be one of liberalism or one of reac- tion?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Shall the American government framed with primary regard ‘to the interests of a few or to promote the welfare of all?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Shal Ithe American government be made to embody the idea of every man for himself?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Shall the American peopl: through this government reassume<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Such an issue as this transcends every question of today. We face < world wherein the supreme materia! problem is that of the equitable dis- tribution of wealth. The democratic party stands for the position that law and government policy should encourage the distribution of that wealth with all proper regard for ‘he toil of the men who produce it: ‘he republican party for the doc- trine that if we turn the major por- ‘ion of that wealth to the competent few they will themselves distribute ' for the benefit of the many.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Utmost Democracy.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The democratic party stands for the utmost possible democracy in industry; the republican for 2 glori- fied oligarchy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“! stand for prosperity and for measures which will protect the property rights of every human be- ing. But I believe that while prop- erty tights must be respected, there are human rights whose worthiness transcends every material consider- ation. Every day we face new prob- lems involving the opportunity of the human spirit to realize its high- est possibility. We cannot allow the development of man to be circum: scribed by ancient formulas. The republican party stands pat; it is essentially the party of reaction.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The democratic party looks for- ward: it is essentially the party of progress and liberalism. We treas- -e the wisdom of the ancients, W venerate and take full account of the experience of mankind, but we rec: ognize that the human. soul does<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;realize its greatest attainment vithin the confines of a machine. that machine of steel, a Corpor:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organization or of ancidnt for- ‘ula.

There can be no compromise vith reaction.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There was a time in the grfat war when this country passed ‘hrough a period of spiritual exalta- ‘ion such as it had never known before. Everyone was glad, yea, eager to sacrifice for the sake of whatever things were true. The query of every citizen was: ‘What can   do for my neighbors and my riends? What can I dofor my coun- ‘ry?
