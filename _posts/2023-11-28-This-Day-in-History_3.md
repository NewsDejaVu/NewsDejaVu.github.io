| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (AP) — In an age of deepfakes and post-truth, as artificial intelligence rose and Elon Musk turned Twitter into X, the Merriam-Webster word of the year for 2023 is “authentic.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authentic cuisine. Authentic voice. Authentic self. Authenticity as artifice. Lookups for the word are routinely heavy on the dictionary company’s site but were boosted to new heights throughout the year, editor at large Peter Sokolowski told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We see in 2023 a kind of crisis of authenticity,” he said ahead of Monday’s announcement of this year’s word. “What we realize is that when we question authenticity, we value it even more.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sokolowski and his team don’t delve into the reasons people head for dictionaries and websites in search of specific words. Rather, they chase the data on lookup spikes and world events that correlate. This time around, there was no particularly huge boost at any given time but a constancy to the increased interest in “authenti ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/merriam-webster-word-of-year-2023-a9fea610cb32ed913bc15533acab71cc](https://apnews.com/article/merriam-webster-word-of-year-2023-a9fea610cb32ed913bc15533acab71cc) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDITOR'S NOTE—Monday’s Fourth will be 200 plus one. But nice as that may be, it won't compare with last year’s Bicentennial outpouring. A re- porter remembers what it was like on that rare weekend, and reflects on its enduring legacy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NN Qa ee ee<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drums seem muffled this year, the trumpets muted. The Tall Ships are scattered to the ports of the world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in memory now is that touch of glory, that rare sense of family, the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thrill, the pride, the surprise at finding us one again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure, this July Fourth the church bells will peal, the colors unfurl, the bands parade, the clam-fires kindle as America celebrates the first birthday of its third century.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not with the glitter, the rapture, the pure unabashed joy of 215 million voices singing one grand song.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Same time next year?’’ We should have known it wouldn't be. Times like those are rare, and rightly so.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember New York, where parades thundered up and down the granite<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; avenues, where the tall ships fluttered sail and glided along the Hudson River with eye-watering majesty, where the warships of 22 nations, all flying the American flag, stood by at salute, where people jammed the waterfronts and riverview apartments and carpeted the feet of the Lady of the Harbor?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this Fourth of July, only the Shriners will march in parade. Seven ocean liners will make a brief foray into the Hudso, and a fleet of small sailboats will race around Long Island.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember Washington, where a mammoth fireworks display lit the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; night sky, where 9,000 special Bicenten- nial flags fluttered from spires and roof- tops, where the National Archives stayed open around the clock so that thousands who lined up could see the na- tion's birth certificate?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year the archives are back on ‘‘a normal summer schedule’’ and the firepower of the fireworks is back to normal, too. The flags were unfurled on Flag Day in June, and the Folk Festival that added spice to last July Fourth is scheduled for September this year.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember San Francisco, where last<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Continued on Page 5)  |
