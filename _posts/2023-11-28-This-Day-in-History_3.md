| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are two things that any American who has been within three feet of a news source over the past seven years can identify as central to Donald Trump’s worldview, they are these: Russia did not interfere in the 2016 presidential election — or maybe it did, or maybe someone else did — but regardless, it didn’t matter, and Trump won on the strength of his own personal skills, and Trump’s loss in the 2020 election was not a function of his personal failures but, instead, of systems rigged against him in the abstract or directly altered to his detriment. It’s very much in keeping with his view of Republican results in the 2022 midterms, articulated to NewsNation last year: “I think if they win, I should get all the credit. If they lose, I should not be blamed at all.” The 2016 election was all him, all his success; 2020 was all a function of the deep state or elites or whoever constructing a fraudulent simulacrum of democracy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There’s just one problem.

Otis today.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denying new trials to two wo- men and three men in the rapid- ly widening vote fraud _ cases, Judge Otis called attention to a reference to the Klan in the de- fense appeal brief.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What an unfortunate reference that is,” Judge Otis said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Now citizens, not negroes only, but men and women of all races lift up their hands here in Kansas City for protection in the same constitutional rights from the fraud and violence, not—it is true—of the Ku Klux Klan but of powers and conspirators just as completely sinister, barbaric, un-American.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accusing all defendants of ul- timately aiming to “steal the election for all candidates on the the democratic ticket,” Judge Otis made pointed reference to Joseph Maher, a precinct captain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said Maher, “seemingly un- usually intellizent and_ strong willed,” called Don Pasqualino “and other unidentified ruffiians,” to drive off an honest election judge and strengthen “the reso- lution of the weak-kneed among defendants.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maher received the most severe sentence, five years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five, convicted at the ninth conspiracy trial, increased the total to 46 as the federal grand jury probed even deeper, consid- ering as the latest angle the sup- ply of bonds to defendants.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly one-half of England’s population consists of hachelore  |
