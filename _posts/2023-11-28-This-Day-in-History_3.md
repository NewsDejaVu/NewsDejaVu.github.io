Landon 61 votes. In truth and in fact, the votes cast for Mr. Roosevelt num- bered 570 and those cast for Mr. Landon were 170.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vincent J. Doherty, chief deputy election commissioner, first witness called after the trial opened late yesterday, was recalled to the stand today after Bellemere was excused.
