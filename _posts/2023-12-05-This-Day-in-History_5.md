| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than a week after his historic expulsion from the House of Representatives, ousted New York Rep. George Santos is speaking out — and he’s saying it for $350 a message. The disgraced ex-congressman debuted Monday on Cameo, the video-sharing platform where users can commission a personalized message from actors, athletes and varying grades of celebrities. According to archived versions of his profile, Santos started with a $75-per-video fee and quickly upped it before landing on a rate of $350 at the time of publication.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breezy tone of Santos’s Cameos belied the reality that on Friday, he became the sixth member to ever be expelled from the chamber. The bipartisan vote was a forceful response to the array of alleged crimes and ethics violations that emerged during Santos’s 332-day congressional career.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He has — and I don’t say this positively — a very charismatic personality,” said Bruce Newman, a business professor at DePaul University who researches political marketing. “He ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/05/george-santos-cameo/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/05/george-santos-cameo/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep. Wilbur D_ Mills, involved in a bizarre incident early Monday in which a woman companion jumped into the Tidal Basin, remained away from Capitol Hill again Friday as speculation swirled as to the incident’s impact on his political career.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An aide to Mills said the Arkansas Democrat and his family “have a bug.” The aide said he did not know when Mills, chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Commillee, would be able lo resume his congressional duties or his re- election campaigning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mills broke four days of silence on the incident Thurs- day by admitting he was in- volved and saying he was embarrassed and humijiated by the episode. He said he would return to work Friday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veteran congressman has not been seen on Capitol Hill since his speeding car, which was being driven with its lights oul, was stopped early Monday morning by police.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police said Mills emerged (rom the car smelling of alcohol and with his face bleeding. A woman companion, identified by police as Annabel Bal- listella, also emerged from the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; car and then jumped into the Tidal Basin, a backwater of Lhe Potomac River that borders the Jefferson Memorial. The woman was rescued by police.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Baltistella, who has been identified by friends as a former stripper who used the name ‘'Fanne Foxe the Argenline Firecracker," was obviously intoxicated at the time of the incident, police said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mills said in his statement Thursday he was hosting a going-away party for one of Mrs. Baltistella's friends. During the evening, he said, Mrs. Baltistella became ill, he<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tried to have her laken home, there was a struggle and her elbow broke his glasses, causing facial cuts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mills said he did not host the party at home because his wile, Polly, had a broken foot. Mrs. Mills did not accompany the group.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mills said he and his wife met Mrs. Battistella and her husband, Eduardo, when the Mills moved to a suburban apartment complex in Arlington, Va., where the Raltistellas already had an apartment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battistella was nol in the wroup of party-goers. The<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington Star-News said Mrs. Batlistella told attendants at a Washinglon hospital she and her husband were separated and he was in Argentina.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mills’ explanation of the in- cident caused talk both in Washinglon and in Arkansas and a colleague of the 19term congressman predicled Mills may be dead politically.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“  think he’s a goner,” said Rep. Thomas I. Ashley, D-Ohio. “I don’t think it needed to be falal but he allowed il to be fatal. You don'l disappear for four days with no explanation.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ashley himself survived a similarly embarrassing scrape lwo years ago when police in Toledo, Ohio, found him drunk and asleep beside the road in his car. He spent three days in jail.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arkansas Democral, a Tattle Rock newspaper, called Mills’ explanalion “late and skimpy" but urged the state’s voters to be understanding.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even thouyh the incident was “pretty wild behavior,” it was “pot unique ... and on the basis of no more than we know now, it would be unfair lo crucify Mills<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just because he got cauzht and is widely known," the newspaper said.  |
