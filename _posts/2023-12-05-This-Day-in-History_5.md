| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than a week after his historic expulsion from the House of Representatives, ousted New York Rep. George Santos is speaking out — and he’s saying it for $350 a message. The disgraced ex-congressman debuted Monday on Cameo, the video-sharing platform where users can commission a personalized message from actors, athletes and varying grades of celebrities. According to archived versions of his profile, Santos started with a $75-per-video fee and quickly upped it before landing on a rate of $350 at the time of publication.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breezy tone of Santos’s Cameos belied the reality that on Friday, he became the sixth member to ever be expelled from the chamber. The bipartisan vote was a forceful response to the array of alleged crimes and ethics violations that emerged during Santos’s 332-day congressional career.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He has — and I don’t say this positively — a very charismatic personality,” said Bruce Newman, a business professor at DePaul University who researches political marketing. “He ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/05/george-santos-cameo/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/05/george-santos-cameo/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — Harrison A. Williams Jr., facing in- surmountable odds against his ex- pulsion from the Senate, has decided to resign, congressional sources said today.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One source, who asked not to be identified, said Williams had drafted a letter of resignation to be delivered later today to Vice President George Bush, in his constitutional role as president of the Senate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This source said Williams, a liberal New Jersey Democrat, planned to make an impassioned declaration in a floor speech of his innocence in the FBI’s undercover Abscam_in- vestigation, and then would leave the Capitol.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams’ chief defender, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, planned to disclose that Williams had written and delivered the resignation letter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sources say Williams, 62, had told colleagues privately that he intends to resign after waging a losing, seven-month battle to avoid ex- pulsion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There still was a slight possibility Williams might change his mind before the Senate votes on the ex- pulsion resolution. If the resolution is adopted, Williams would be the first senator to be expelled since the Civil War.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams was described as being distraught over his situation and that has accounted for his hesitation about his intentions, sources said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicly, the 23-year veteran of the Senate said Wednesday that he would continue to fight expulsion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could not be determined whether Williams would resign before the Senate votes on a proposal that he be censured, a lesser penalty that has<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been urged by those who argue that he was the victim of FBI and prosecutorial abuse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate had been expected to vote on censure Wednesday, but the vote was postponed and could come today.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the sponsor of the censure vote, Democratic Whip Alan Cran- ston, D-Calif., said it would fail. And Cranston that if Williams does not resign, it will be impossible for him to avoid expulsion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the censure vote, assuming it is taken, the Senate would turn its attention once again to the expulsion resolution recommended unanimously by the Senate Ethics Committee last summer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disclosure about William’s plans came as a chorus grew among Senate Democrats for Williams’ expulsion.  |
