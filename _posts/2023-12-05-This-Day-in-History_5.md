Allan Shivers said he would take no action until after the general election.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor, just back from a two-week bear hunt in Alaska, held his first press conference since receiving a letter of resig- nation from Daniel effective Jan. 15 or when a successor is elect- ed and qualified.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said he had not accepted the resignation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The letter of resignation does not create such a vacancy as would permit holding an election on Nov. 6 and no further an- nouncement will be made until after the general election,” Shiv- ers said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor said a_ special Senate election “has no place be- ing mixed up in a_ presidential election.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said he and his office were still studying the question as to when a vacancy actually occurs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Only after we find the answer to that will we be able to set a date for a special election,’ Shiv- ers said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniel filed his resignation un- der a section cf the law providing for resignations in the future. It empowers the governor to order a special election not less than 20 nor more than 90 days after he receives it. Another law pro- vides for an election 60-90 days after the resignation. This leaves the possibility that an election might be set as late as April 15.  |
