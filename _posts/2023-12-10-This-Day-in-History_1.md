| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;___<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCAA is not taking medals away from transgender athlete Lia Thomas<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLAIM: The NCAA is transferring medals won by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas to Riley Gaines, another former Division I swimmer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE FACTS: The claim first appeared in an article that is clearly labeled as satire. An NCAA spokesperson told The Associated Press that Thomas and Gaines tied for fifth place in the women’s 200-yard freestyle race at a 2022 championship meet and that the results are final. The false claim circulated amid a congressional hearing on Tuesday that examined the participation of transgender athletes in women’s sports. “NCAA Reevaluates Medal Distribution, Acknowledges Mistake And Will Transfer Medals from Lia Thomas to Riley Gaines,” reads one Facebook post.

Olympic medal winners, who in- spired spectators in the stands and kept millions before their television sets for two weeks, to- day were given a welcome that the nation’s capital usually reserves for heroes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led by Mayor MarionS. Barry, the athletes rode down Penn- sylvania Avenue in four ‘‘Tour- mobiles’’ to the cheers of crowds along the way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parade, which began near the White House, was ending at the Capitol, where the Olympians were being honored with a joint congressional resolution honor- ing their achievements in Los Angeles and a musical tribute from the Air Force Band.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the parade, swimmer Mike O’Brien, who won a gold medalin the 1,500-meter freestyle, said the athletes’ reception was ‘‘terrific. It’s nice to see people come out,”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One woman waiting for the parade, Wilma Weinsman of suburban Fairfax, Va., said she had brought her 13-year-old daughter, Debbie, to see the parade because ‘‘They spent years of training and working, and made a major effort on their part. We should put out a little for them."’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry Carlson, a spokesman for the Southland Corp., which is paying for travel and lodging, said 221 medalists accepted the company’s travel invitation and each was allowed to bring a guest. Some chose a parent, some pick-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ed friends or their coaches.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States won 174 medals, including 83 gold ones at the 23rd Olympiad. But the number of athletes on the trip swelled because entire teams of medalists from the Summer Games were invited, the entire basketball squad, for example. The guests also include some U.S. medalists from the Winter Games in Yugoslavia.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after arriving at Dulles Airport outside Washington late<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday, authorities herded the athletes and their guests off buses after word was received that a bomb had been found on board a bus carrying the baggage of Turkish athletes at the Los Angeles International Airport.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It was purely precautionary based on the developments at Los Angeles,’’' said airport spokesman David Hess.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group was delayed about 1%e hours by the search.  |
