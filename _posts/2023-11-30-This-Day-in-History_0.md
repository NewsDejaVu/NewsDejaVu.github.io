| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (AP) — A New York appeals court Thursday reinstated a gag order that barred Donald Trump from commenting about court personnel after the former president repeatedly disparaged a law clerk in his New York civil fraud trial.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-sentence decision came two weeks after an individual appellate judge put the gag order on hold while the appeals process played out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trial judge Arthur Engoron, who imposed the restriction, said he now planned to enforce it “rigorously and vigorously.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trump attorney Christopher Kise called it “a tragic day for the rule of law.” Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, complained that the gag order was “nothing but attempted election interference, which is failing terribly.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engoron imposed the gag order Oct. 3 after Trump posted a derogatory comment about the judge’s law clerk to social media.

Hoffman at the end of the 4'2-month trial.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five defendants were con- victed of crossing state lines to incite rioting at the time of the 1968 Democratic National Con- vention in Chicago. The ruling today by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals does not af- fect those verdicts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the two lawyers and seven defendants who were cited for contempt at the con- clusion of the stormy _ trial, Hoffman also sentenced an original defendant, Bobby G. Seale, to four years for con- tempt. His contempt citation was also overturned.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mistrial was declared in Seale’s case and he was se- vered from the other defend- ants. The government did not<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; retry Seale on the conspiracy charges.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeals court ruling was based on a-U.S. Supreme Court decision that required a_ trial judge to let another judge im- pose contempt sentences if they were not cited until the end of the trial.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoffman imposed the sen- tences the weekend of Feb. 14- 15, 1970, as soon as the jury was sent out to reach a verdict.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seale was granted a mistrial in October 1969 and sentenced to serve three months on each of 16 separate contempt charges.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All seven defendants were ac- quitted by the jury on charges of conspiracy to cross state lines with the intent to incite ri- oting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convicted on the charge of actually crossing state lines to incite rioting were David Del-. linger, Abbot ‘‘Abbie’’ Hoff- man, Jerry C. Rubin, Thomas E. Hayden and Rennard ‘Ren- nie” ‘Davis. They were sen- tenced to five years in prison and fined $5,000 each. They are free pending appeal.  |
