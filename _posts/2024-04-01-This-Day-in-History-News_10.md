(AP) — Workers probed through the tangled wreckage of an unfinished 16-million-dollar bridge Wednesday seeking bodies of men killed in the tragic collapse. Meanwhile British Columbia officials started an investigation into the collapse of the structure late Tuesday. The grotesquely tangled and twisted wreckage of the Second Narrows Bridge over the swift-flowing Burrard Inlet has given up the bodies of 14 workmen crushed or drowned when two 140-foot sections fell from their supports. Two other bodies were visible in the water under the wreckage and two men are missing. More than a score of workmen were being treated in hospitals for injuries ranging from minor to loss of limbs. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FLORENCE Italy (AP) — Michelangelo’s David has been a towering figure in Italian culture since its completion in 1504. But in the current era of the quick buck curators worry the marble statue’s religious and political significance is being diminished by the thousands of refrigerator magnets and other souvenirs sold around Florence focusing on David’s genitalia. The Galleria dell’Accademia’s director Cecilie Hollberg has positioned herself as David’s defender since her arrival at the museum ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/michelangelo-david-statue-italy-protection-heritage-3fa1b7185fea36003e064fa6e2c309fd)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COVENTRY Eng. Oct. 27 - Theyve had to put a fence around Lady Godivas statue to keep the peeping Toms away. A statue showing the lady clad only in her tresses and sitting side saddle on a horse was unveiled last Saturday by Mrs. Lewis Douglas wife of the U.S. ambassador. Almost immediately crowds wanting a closer look began trampling over the surrounding turf. City officials put up a three-foot high barricade yesterday to save the grass. According to legend Godiva rode forth in the nude some 900 years ago to shame her husband the lord of the town into giving tax relief to the people. |

(UPI) — The sulphur carrier Marine Floridian today smashed into the Benjamin Harrison lift bridge collapsing one section and dumping four vehicles into the James River. A Coast Guard spokesman said two survivors were pulled from the water and divers were trying to determine the number of casualties. Two cars and two trucks were found on the river bottom. The vehicles had been waiting on the span for the ship to pass when they were dumped into the murky waters of the James. Early morning motorists watched horrified as the unladen tanker appeared to have a steering failure and headed for the fixed portion of the three-quarter mile long bridge. The 612-foot Marine Floridian which had tried to stop by dropping anchor upstream blasted its horn to warn those on the bridge to get away. Wayne Bolton 31 who was waiting for the ship to pass through the channel as he was on his way to work said the vessel veered slowly toward the fixed span. In desperation Bolton said the ship released its anchors to try to stop. |

The go-slow on space travel dreams was sounded by Wilson W. Rosen director of the Viking Rocket Project Naval Research Laboratory. He declared he has a ‘down-to-earth attitude about space travel after six years’ work at the White Sands Proving Grounds in New Mexico where rockets have been shot to heights of 250 miles. But he says we don’t know enough about lots of things to send men up in rockets to explore and travel through space with any real degree of safety. Another expert declared that in 10 to 15 years we could have a man-made satellite whizzing around the earth at an altitude of 1075 miles with 80 to 100 humans aboard it. The authority is Dr. Wernher von Braun technical director of the U. S. guided missiles development group in Huntsville Ala. and the scientist who developed the German V-2 rocket in World War II. From this satellite he said we could take off in rockets to the moon or elsewhere in space. |

While both involve reproductive health emergency contraception ‒ often called Plan B ‒ is meant to stop a pregnancy from happening and the abortion pill mifepristone ends an existing pregnancy medical experts say.

Carter made the observation in response to a question at his news conference Tuesday. “There are many things in life that are not fair that wealthy people can afford and poor people cant” the President said. ‘But I don’t believe that the federal government should take action to try to make these opportunities exactly equal particularly when there is a moral factor involved.” |

The long delay in deciding the case had caused speculation. The court also upheld the validity of the railway labor act of 1934 companion legislation to the Wagner labor act and the farm mortgage moratorium act. The minimum wage decision which served to affirm the decree of the court in favor of the law was made possible by Justice Roberts shifting from the conservative to the liberal side of the bench. The four regular justices in the New York minimum wage case the decision of which threatened to create a political issue agreed that under the courts 1923 decision in the Adkins District of Columbia case the New York law must fall. This decision of 1923 has served to strike down all minimum wage legislation for women since that date. The railway labor act decision was made in a suit involving the Virginian Railway company. |

| Weight Loss Drugs Cost $1000 A Month But Less Than $25 To Make. Why Do We Pay So Much? | Senate To Probe Diet Pill Industry |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New-generation weight-loss drugs can retail for about $1350 a month but a new study from Yale University suggests they cost just $22 to make. Similarly life-saving insulin can be manufactured for well under $250 a year the study found but it took pressure from the Biden administration to bring out-of-pocket costs for many Americans down to about $420 annually. Everyone likes to complain about how much drug companies are overcharging for medications but it\s been nearly impossible to know ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/03/29/ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-diabetes-drug-cost/73125135007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — A Senate investigation was announced Tuesday into the diet pill industry where Sen. Phillip A. Hart said a patient’s health and purse can often be reduced as rapidly as his weight. Hart a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Senate antitrust subcommittee said in a statement that a six-month staff inquiry has turned up strong indications that: Drug suppliers specializing in diet pills recruit doctors into the weight-reducing field as an implement manufacturer might seek dealers sometimes promising physicians yearly incomes of $100000 to $300000. Mass production handling of patients by many obesity specialists precludes the kind of careful medical attention essential to safe use of diet drugs. No date was set for the start of hearings but Hart said he hopes to get them under way early in the new year. Hart’s announcement of public hearings on the diet pill industry was made as a Senate small business subcommittee under the chairmanship of Sen. Gaylord Nelson D-Wis. continued its probe of pricing practices by prescription drug manufacturers Nelson said a 29-city survey conducted by his office showed widespread and shocking price differences paid by public agencies with taxpayers’ funds for prescription drugs. The obvious conclusion to be drawn he said is that the price charged to public agencies is whatever the traffic will bear in each particular instance. The most extreme example cited by Nelson was a spread of 11655 per cent between the price paid by Grand Rapids Mich. and Cook County Chicago for reserpine tablets. He said that while Grand Rapids was paying $160 for 5000 tablets the price paid by Chicago was $2.09. Grand Rapids was buying on a trade name basis Nelson said while Cook countys order was for a generic product supplied by a generic house. Another example he cited involved sulfate tablets. Nelson said that while Des Moines and Newark were paying $22.60 for this drug on a trade name basis the city of Los Angeles was buying on a generic basis. |

One of the circulars it is sending throughout the country shows three rocking chairs labeled “His” “Bobby’s” and “Teddy’s.” The accompanying text asking contributions says: “A rocker gives a fellow the illusion of going someplace when he’s really sitting still. (If you rock hard enough itll back up on you.) “Thats the way it is with the country today. We may be moving (back and forth sideways up and down) but it doesn’t exactly appear to be forward.” |
