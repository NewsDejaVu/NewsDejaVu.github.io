| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden stood firm Monday against calls for him to drop his reelection candidacy and called for an end to the intraparty drama that has torn apart Democrats since his dismal debate performance last month as key lawmakers expressed support for him to remain in the 2024 presidential race. As anxious congressional Democrats returned to Washington weighing whether to work to revive his campaign or to try to edge him out Biden sent them an open letter aiming to silence ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/biden-campaign-house-democrats-senate-16c222f825558db01609605b3ad9742a)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PITTSBURGH Oct. 27 - Pennsylvania Republicans whooped it up for President Eisenhower Monday night as he sailed into the Democrats calling them a divided party with a radical wing of spendthrifts visionaries and boondogglers. On a night of cold driving rain the crowd in the Syria mosque failed to reach the overflow proportions GOP leaders had hoped to attract. But those who braved the weather cheered him lustily when said his administration had achieved economic resurgence without flogging the economy into inflation and kept the peace despite international tension. The election of a Democratic congress he declared would bring on feuding—futile—deadlocked government. It is two parties at war within one party the president said of the Democratic party. And never the twain shall meet—except at election time. The hall in which he spoke has a capacity of 3800 There were some 300 to 400 vacant seats. But enroute here the president was greeted by thousands who lined both sides of about a dozen blocks of Liberty and Fifth avenues as his motorcade through the rain from the airport to the auditorium. Pittsburgh Republican leaders estimated the crowd at 3500. They had made preparations for a full house in the main auditorium and for an overflow crowd of up to 2500 in a separate basement auditorium. Another big crowd—also in raincoats and umbrellas—greeted him when he landed at the greater Pittsburgh airport when he flew in from a political rally at the county airport at Charleston West Va. Maintaining the hard-hitting tempo of his campaign for a Republican congress Eisenhower said in praising his administrations handling of the recession: The formula of the radical wing of the opposition was a resort to panic and a raid on the— |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOS ANGELES (AP) — The damages a federal jury has ordered the NFL to pay for violating antitrust laws in distributing out-of-market Sunday afternoon games on a premium subscription service is $4707259944.64. The figures from the June 27 judgment against the NFL were listed on the verdict form which was posted on the case docket Tuesday.

Giles pointed out that a Fulton County Georgia court already has enjoined the league and the Braves from playing home games anywhere but in Atlanta. He also said a federal court in Houston Texas has ordered the league not to change its 1966 schedule which calls for Braves’ home games to be played in Atlanta. The league expects the appeal to establish that the Milwaukee court which issued yesterday’s decision has no jurisdiction or power to force the league and the Braves to return to Milwaukee or to provide an expansion team to play in a state which charges that the National league is violating its antitrust laws Giles’ statement said. He said that although the order of the Milwaukee court ignores the Georgia and Texas orders the National league cannot legally and properly do so. The league expects the appeal to establish that the defense was denied a fair trial. |

(AP Photo/Aurelien Morissard) “Our country is facing an unprecedented political situation and is preparing to welcome the world in a few weeks.” That’s from Prime Minister Gabriel Attal who plans to offer his resignation on Monday.

Rabins resignation Monday night was a tactical maneuver designed to undercut rivals within his ruling Labor party and take Israel to the polls before an embryonic centrist movement could get strong enough to challenge him. The government was preparing a bill dissolving the Knesset and calling an election for a new parliament. There must be at least 143 days between the resignation of the cabinet and the balloting and an election in late May was expected. This would be five months before the Knesset’s term would have ended. Meanwhile Rabin and his cabinet remain in office as a caretaker government. Rabins chief opponents in the election will be the right-wing Likud bloc which advocates annexation of all Arab territory Israel occupied in the 1967 war. It won 39 of the 120 Knesset seats to the Laborites’ 51 in the 1973 election. Rabin advocates retention of some of the occupied territory including the Golan Heights East Jerusalem and the east coast of the Sinai peninsula overlooking the approach to Elat Israels southern port. But he proposes to trade most of the West Bank of the Jordan river the Gaza Strip and the rest of the occupied Sinai for peace with the Arabs. There is no chance of the Arabs agreeing to either position. Rabin used a dispute with the National Religious party (NRP) over a government ceremony that lasted until after the start of the Jewish Sabbath as the pretext for the government upheaval. The NRP was the second largest member of the government coalition. A former army chief of staff and ambassador to Washington Rabin succeeded Prime Minister Golda Meir in 1972. |

Senior advisers and longtime allies insist they still don’t know whom the presumptive GOP nominee will choose to join him on the ticket — with many believing the name ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/trump-vp-announcement-rubio-vance-burgum-bc0f59de167c8601572daed08b26eb69)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1960 presidential campaign entered its final full week Sunday with a promise from Sen. John F. Kennedy that he would continue supporting separation of church and state even if 99 per cent of Americas population were Catholic. The Constitution and my conscience happen to be in very close harmony Kennedy declared. Kennedy reaffirmed his position in the continuing debate over his Roman Catholic faith in a TV-radio interview—CBS Face the Nation—after a fifth day of campaigning in vote-rich Pennsylvania. Kennedy’s rival Vice President Richard M. Nixon the Republican presidential nominee took a sabbath breather from campaigning to rest at his Washington D.C. home with his wife and family. Nixon after a week of whistle-stopping in the Midwest was pictured as feeling that five big states which hold the key to the election still are up for grabs. The five states were said to be New York Pennsylvania Ohio Michigan and Illinois. Nixon rated all five as about 50-50 with the election nine days away. In two other big states Texas and his native California Nixon believes he has mounting strength but is not claiming either as a clinch right now. Kennedy in his TV interview agreed as he put it that the race is very close and will go right down to the wire. However he refused to concede any of the big states to Nixon. He declared that there is no conflict between his faith and his duties as a public servant and that nothing could prevent him from carrying out those duties. Earlier in a talk to a campaign rally at Levittown north of Philadelphia Kennedy set a national goal of 82 million jobs and full employment by 1968. I pledge myself and my party to seeking 82 million jobs by 1968 he said. Nixon also expanded his views on one of the nations increasingly acute problems—the role of the elderly. In a long statement one of a series of position papers in which Nixon has been supplementing his speeches the vice president said: We must encourage more flexible retirement policies and provide more job opportunities for older people who can and want to work. He advocated a nine-point program ranging from increased investment in plans for rehabilitation of the physically and mentally handicapped to further steps to provide more senior citizens with housing. |

Dec. 16— Marlene Dietrich made her nightclub debut last night in the most revealing gown that show business veterans could remember. The veteran glamour girl opened at the Sahara and her first appearance drew a gasp from the capacity audience. She sauntered on stage in a gown of transparent black net and little else. The gown a clinging number designed by Jean Louis for a reported $6000 revealed more than it concealed. Joe Shoenfeld entertainment veteran and editor of Daily Variety said: “It’s the most daring gown I’ve ever seen on a stage and I covered New York burlesque in the old days.” A consensus of other reviewers drew similar comments. I asked one what he thought of the gown. “What gown?” he replied. “I think she was smart to wear it” said another. “People expect sex from Dietrich. They got it.” After the show the glamorous grandmother served champagne for the press in her suite. She was dressed in a circus ringmaster outfit that exposed her famous legs. She was asked why she chose such a daring costume. “That is Las Vegas” she replied. “If you can’t wear it here you can’t wear it anywhere.” She was asked if her type of sex appeal hadn’t disappeared from Hollywood. “Are you kidding?” she replied. “Youve got Marilyn Monroe you should have it so good.” How does she keep her fabulous figure? “I have no system. I eat whatever I want. I don’t exercise but I keep active.” Will she do any more nightclubs? “Only if others meet my salary here Im drawing $90000 for the weeks.” Chances are shell play nowhere else. No other place can afford such a salary. Miss Dietrich came on stage with billing “the most glamorous star in the world—the woman and the legend.” With her strawberry blond hair in a short cut she was attired in the startling gown plus a 10-foot double train of black fox. She sang nine songs. Her voice can best be described as a foggy and slightly off key baritone But the patrons of the Las Vegas gambling establishment. |

Miss Margaret Smith whose wits are as spry as her fingers says years of reading detective story magazines helped her turn the tables yesterday on two women who apparently picked her for an easy mark. Miss Smith told police she was approached by a woman while shopping in the Brooklyn business district. The woman told her that a friend had just found $3800 in a man’s wallet and did not know what to do with it. A few blocks away they met the friend. Miss Smith told them to take the money to the police. First the ‘friend’ said she would ask her boss. She entered a nearby building and later emerged to say the employer had advised splitting the find three ways—‘since three people knew about it.” Miss Smith was asked to put up her life savings as evidence of ‘good faith.” With the others traipsing along Miss Smith went to her apartment got her bankbook with which to withdraw the $900. There she prepared a note: “I am the victim of a confidence game. Call the police.” At the Williamsburg Savings Bank she passed the note instead of a withdrawal slip to a teller. Two detectives arrived at the bank and Miss Smith led them outside where they arrested Shirley Shay 27 and Orvilla Jenkins both of Manhattan. They were charged with attempted grand larceny. “That old con games so old I recognized it immediately” snorted Miss Smith. |

| 20 Tech Tricks To Make Life Better Safer Or Easier | Built-In Mania Is Great Curse Of Modern Age |

Below you’ll find 20 sweet shortcuts — some new some hidden gems that have been there all along. Election deepfakes are everywhere: Before you hit share on any image or video try a reverse image search. Open Google and click Images at the top. You can drag and drop or upload a photo. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/tech-tricks-make-life-better-safer-easier)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the bustling age. Nobody any longer wants anything unless it is also guaranteed to have at least a couple of other features built into it. This goes for practically everything from brassieres to bookcases from three-color ice cream to cigarette boxes that play Yankee Doodle when opened. If it doesnt have that built-in something extra it’s strictly twenty-three skiddoo. Even the pigeons turn up their beaks at popcorn today unless it contains three kinds of built-in vitamins. Think Im kidding? Well over in Glasgow theyve just developed a blouse with built-in perfume. Makes a girl smell sweet in any flavor she wants for months and months. But this international craze to build something into something else probably has reached its true flower in the motor car and household gadget industries. An automobile used to be a vehicle to get you from here to there. But now cars are gradually taking the place of the old fashioned home. You can shave in them listen to a concert smoke carry on a long distance telephone conversation with Paris or push a button and slice your mother-in-law in half with an automatic sliding window. About the only thing you cant do in them is play a tuba. Take what happened to the simple broom. It used to be a straightforward instrument for gathering dust out of odd corners. Then they turned it into a carpet sweeper. Then it developed into the vacuum cleaner. And what wont it do now? It can paint walls wax floors dry the baby manicure the furniture and shampoo your rug or your dog or your wife. In another year itll serve meals fight peddlers attack poisonous snakes and play you gin rummy for keeps. Furniture has become so complicated by built-in gadgets that you cant even tell its function from an outside look. Soon we’ll have to hang an index on each piece to know all it is capable of. Youll have to approach it by radar. As it is now I always have a moment of fear when a host asks me to pull open or stop at a new cabinet in a living room. I never know whether the thing will dump a sack of laundry on the floor spray me with martinis or just show another television wrestling match from Chicago. Yes its all confused. You dial a telephone and someone complains youre turning off the air-conditioning unit. Are we living at peace in the built-in war or dwelling at war in a built-in peace? Call a sociopolitical adviser. The plane away. This corner saloon no longer offers any escape. I met a friend emerging from one the other day and he said with a dazed look What a few slot machine they got in there! I put in a nickel. And what happened? Why the darn thing rang up a 1000000 score shot out three Roman candles weighed me shined my shoes told my fortune played a Bing Crosby record and reached into my pocket for another nickel. Don’t go in there pal. I bet if Id put in a quarter the thing would probably have married me moved into my apartment and set up housekeeping. There is only one way to beat the built-in wave. Thats to stave off the race with some built-in common sense. Who really wants a fountain pen that will write letters brush his teeth take his passport photo and — for fifty cents extra — have three knife blades and a bottle opener at one end? |
