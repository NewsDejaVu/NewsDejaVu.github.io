| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LONDON (AP) — The pharma giant AstraZeneca has requested that the European authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine be pulled according to the EU medicines regulator. In an update on the European Medicines Agency’s website Wednesday the regulator said that the approval for AstraZeneca’s Vaxzevria had been withdrawn “at the request of the marketing authorization holder.” AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine was first given the nod by the EMA in January 2021. Within weeks however concerns grew about ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-covid-eu-a3c108dd0ca305cf1b6da764e9a37abc)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you catch a cold by years end - as you and most other Americans probably will - you should hope it is caused by the corona virus. Not that you will be any less miserable. You wont. Not that your doctor will have any more luck curing the attack. He wont. But with a corona-caused cold youll at least be one of the in crowd upper-respiratorially speaking. That is youll be suffering from the latest thing in the common cold - a virus in effect as mod and up-to-date as the mini-skirt. The corona - so named because it is shaped somewhat like a microscopic regal crown - is a newly recognized recruit in the varied and ever-growing brigade of villainous bugs that can cause the common cold one of mankind’s oldest most prevalent costly and baffling maladies. But with the discovery of the corona virus comes this conclusion of prominent researchers: Chances appear slimmer than ever for any major breakthrough in the near future toward developing conventional preventive vaccines against all the multiple varieties of cold-causing germs. The scientists say the only hope for any major conquest of the common cold in the foreseeable future rests on new experiments aimed at developing chemical drugs - as distinguished from vaccines which are made up of toned-down versions of the viruses themselves. As the international quest continues for ways to cure or prevent the common cold the legions of water-eyed runny-nosed scratchy-throated Americans are involved in statistics like these: Virtually all the nation’s 200 million people have at least one cold a year and many have up to five - for a total of nearly 1 billion bouts. Colds cost the nation more than $5 billion yearly in lost wages lost production and medical expenses including more than $400 million for respiratory pharmaceuticals whose benefits says the U.S. Public Health Service are questionable. Nearly every employed American loses about four work-days a year and nearly every child about six school days from respiratory ills. Children get twice as many colds as adults. |

MANCHESTER England - An engine exploded on a British Airtours plane as it sped down the runway on takeoff Thursday and flames swiftly engulfed the Boeing 737 killing 54 people. Eighty-three survived the inferno and the panic of the escape. As the pilot brought the plane to a halt at the edge of the runway passengers leaped to the tarmac and stewards flung people down escape chutes in the desperate minutes before flames overtook them survivors said. The plane stopped about 300 yards from an airport fire station and firemen reached the jet in minutes. Gil Thompson airport manager said however that a severed fuel line may have doused the twin-jet aircraft with fuel and that it then became really a towering inferno. The plane was taking 131 package-tour passengers and six crew to Corfu in the Greek islands. Survivor Keith Middleton 21 of Liverpool said that as flames spread everyone was screaming and shouting. They were diving out of their seats and everyone was pushing. People were falling onto the floor and getting trampled on. Hilary Loftus told of holding her baby and jumping from the plane into the arms of her husband who had just gotten out with their young daughter. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher flew to this industrial city in northwest England at the end of her holiday in Austria. She viewed the wreckage and spent 75 minutes comforting survivors. Fifteen survivors were held at Manchesters Wythenshawe Hospital mainly with burns. The rest were released after treatment for minor injuries and shock. British Airtours a subsidiary of state-owned British Airways specializes in taking Britons on package tours to holiday resorts. There was no indication any foreigners were on the flight. The Manchester Airport Authority said the jet was roaring down the runway at about 100 mph just after 7 a.m. when the pilot radioed he had a problem with the engine on his left wing. Thompson said the pilot aborted the takeoff and stopped the plane within 30 to 40 seconds turning it into a taxiway near an airport fire station. He said within minutes seven fire engines were spewing foam onto the plane but still the fire raged out of control billowing into the passenger compartment. |

The weird taxi scene was only one in a 10 hour rampage through Chicago and Berwyn in which F.E. H.

Sackett head of the Utilities Mfg. Corporation of Kansas City came to Chicago a week ago on business followed later by his wife who became alarmed at the messages he telegraphed to her. Receiving word at his hotel that his wife was at the home of her sister in Berwyn a suburb Sackett telephoned that he would drive out shortly. First he called at the home of A. B. Scheyer a chauffeur There he heard the chauffeurs son play the violin and insisted the youth accompany them. Arriving in Berwyn his relatives decided to subject him to a psychopathic examination and persuaded him to reenter the cab and go to a hospital. Sackett submitted quietly to the examination until two policemen summoned by telephone arrived. In the fight that followed one of Sacketts fingers was shot away but he escaped to the cab and compelled Scheyer to drive him away. The youth finally wearied from the ordeal was dropped in front of the Scheyer home but the ride went on. Later Sackett flung himself out of the car and vanished among crowds near the Union station. From the station Sackett telephoned to his wife and his arrest soon followed. |

(AP) — Kansas could soon offer up to $5 million in grants for schools to outfit surveillance cameras with artificial intelligence systems that can spot people carrying guns.

McCormack (D-Mass) the President said legislation he proposed last February would meet the challenge to ‘keep weapons from the hands of the dangerous and still permit the law-abiding citizens to acquire them.’ McCormack made the letter public and said he would make every effort to get House action this year on the President’s proposal. Since August of last year when a hidden sniper in a university tower in Austin Tex. shot 44 people the President wrote McCormack guns have been involved in 6500 murders 10000 suicides 2600 accidental deaths 43500 aggravated assaults and 50000 robberies. ‘A civilized nation cannot allow this armed terror to continue’ he said. ‘An enlightened Congress must not allow it to continue. The time has come for action.’ Last year the President said 2 million guns were sold in this country many of them to hardened criminals snipers mental defectives rapists habitual drunkards and juveniles. ‘There is no excuse for this’ he added. ‘We are long past the point where we can allow lethal weapons to be hawked by the same mail order techniques used to market frozen steaks or baskets of fruit. We are long past the point where we can allow an enemy of society to buy and use a weapon of death and disorder... when existing state laws will not even allow the same person to drive a car or to vote.’ The President said the legislation he proposed would stop interstate mail order sales of firearms stop over-the-counter sales of firearms other than rifles and shotguns to any person not residing within the state of purchase. |
