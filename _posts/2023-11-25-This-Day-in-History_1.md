| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Donald Trump used college football rivalry weekend to bask among his supporters in a state and region that are key to his presidential fortunes, while trying to upstage his Republican opponent Nikki Haley on her home turf at the Clemson-South Carolina football game.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former president and current front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination walked into Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia on Saturday night to chants of “We want Trump! We want Trump!” from fans gathered for the annual Palmetto Bowl, the state’s biggest sporting event of the year.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haley, a Clemson alumna and trustee who was twice elected South Carolina governor, did not attend.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trump was a guest of Gov. Henry McMaster, Haley’s successor. The entourage, which entered through a veritable tunnel of Trump supporters on its way to a private suite, also included South Carolina’s senior U.S. Sen.

Stevenson believes the Democrats /may be coming down with a case of political overconfidence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1952 Democratic presidential nominee told a party rally here ‘Saturday night that ‘‘our party's fortunes have suddenly improved” ‘and operations of the past year have produced comforting results.   What he didn’t say but is known to feel is that the upsurge may have been too sudden for the party’s best interests. He believes overconfidence might result in a slacking off on the pick and shovel Work for next year’s campaign to ‘Tecapture control of Congress from ‘the GOP,   As the former Illinois governor sees it, the Democrats may be ‘somewhat “intoxicated” with re- cent election victories that netted the governorship of New Jersey, ‘House seats in New Jersey and Wisconsin and victories in a num- ber of municipal races.   Certainly these successes were on the tongues of party leaders “and operators at an all day rally Saturday. The rally lapped over jinto Sunday morning for a meeting of the Democratic National Com- mittee’s advisory council given over to chit-chat with Stevenson.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the recent election vic- tors were given speaking roles, in advance of Stevenson, at a fund- raising dinner which packed 1,285 paying partisans into the ballroom of the Bellevue Stratford Hotel at $100 a plate. They were Robert Meyner, governor-elect of New   Jersey, and Robert F. Wagner Jr.,   mayor-elect of New York City.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stevenson told the whoop-it-up party gathering from 11 eastern states and the District of Columbia that the late President Roosevelt's four freedoms have been replaced ‘iby “the four fears.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freedom of speech and of wor- ship, freedom from want and from fear, he said, have given way to “fear of depression, fear of com- munism, fear of ourselves, fear of freedom itself.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he _ questioned President Eisenhower's ability to “‘speak for the Eisenhower administration,” when Eisenhower speaks of unity and “his colleagues show disunity.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stevenson cut loose at Atty. Gen. Brownell — and so did former Vice President Barkley in far harsher terms — on the issue of Soviet espionage. He said the at- torney general has “imputed dis- loyalty or Communist sympathy” to former President Truman.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subversion and treachery are serious, Stevenson said, and doubt- less there were mistakes in han- dling them.
