| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (AP) — Rep. George Santos said he expects to be expelled from Congress following a scathing report by the House Ethics Committee that found substantial evidence of lawbreaking by the New York Republican.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a defiant speech Friday sprinkled with taunts and obscenities aimed at his congressional colleagues, Santos insisted he was “not going anywhere.” But he acknowledged that his time as a member of Congress, at least, may soon be coming to an end.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I know I’m going to get expelled when this expulsion resolution goes to the floor,” he said Friday night during a conversation on X Spaces. “I’ve done the math over and over, and it doesn’t look really good.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comments came one week after the Republican chairman of the House Ethics Committee, Michael Guest, introduced a resolution to expel Santos once the body returns from Thanksgiving break.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Santos has survived two expulsion votes, many of his colleagues who formerly opposed the effort now say they support it, citing t ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/george-santos-house-ethics-committee-bf33ec0df1997467617f5d19531a4b26](https://apnews.com/article/george-santos-house-ethics-committee-bf33ec0df1997467617f5d19531a4b26) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — Top Democratic leaders threw their weight Friday against House Armed _ Services Chairman F.

O'Neill Jr. added bluntly :<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘In my opinion anybody in the Democratic Caucus who joins any such coalition (for Hebert) should be stripped of his seniority and maybe<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ejected from the caucus.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker and O'Neill took their hard stands after the Democratic Steering Committee bowed to the will of the House Democrats and recommended seating two committee chairmen it earlier voted dumped.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Steering C ommittee unanimously reversed itself and recommended _ that Banking Committee Chair- man Wright Patman and Administration Committee Chairman Wayne L. Hays keep their jobs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Steering Committee also recommended unanimously that Hebert be replaced with Rep. Melvin Price, D-Il., and that deposed Agriculture Committee<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chairman W. R. Poage be re- placed with Rep. Thomas S. Foley D-Wash.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hebert announced after the Democrats voted Thursday to dump him and Poage that he would carry a possibly un- precedented battle to the full House to overturn the action.  |
