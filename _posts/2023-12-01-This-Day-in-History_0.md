| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel’s war with Hamas erupted again Friday, as airstrikes hit houses and buildings in the Gaza Strip minutes after a weeklong truce expired. Health authorities in the besieged territory reported dozens of Palestinians killed and Israel dropped leaflets over Gaza City and southern parts of the enclave, urging civilians to flee to avoid the fighting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Militants in Gaza resumed firing rockets into Israel, and fighting broke out between Israel and Hezbollah militants operating along its northern border with Lebanon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resumption of the war threatens to compound the suffering in Gaza. Some 2 million people -- almost its entire population -- are crammed into the territory’s south, where Israel urged people to relocate at the war’s start and has since vowed to extend its ground assault. Unable to go into north Gaza or neighboring Egypt, their only escape is to move around within the 85-square-mile area (220 square kilometers).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renewed hostilities also heig ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-12-1-2023-c944c736efdf8993c7a17cf683d6e364](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-12-1-2023-c944c736efdf8993c7a17cf683d6e364) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel and Syria declared a cease-fire Friday in the 6-day-old Lebanon war, but heavy fighting raged on between Israeli forces and Palestinian guerrillas at the southern approaches to bloady Beirut.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel’s defense chief said his country has “no cease-fire with the terrorists” and a guerrilla leader declared that his fighters ‘‘are not concerned by the cease-fire in any way.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/Fhe Israeli-Syrian standdown took effect at noon, just minutes after Israeli jets devastated Palestinian guerrilla headquarters in furious air and sea bom-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.bardments of the Lebanese capital. Lebanese authorities reported 199 people killed and 444 wounded in those attacks. . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within three hours of the cease-fire, Palestinian artillery crews and Israeli tanks were again trading shellfire near Beirut’s southern beaches, where Israeli units apparently had gained control of the village of Khalde, just south of Beirut’s airport.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lebanese radio said Syrian gunners joined in the Khalde-area artillery duels and, citing unnamed “security sources,” asserted that Israeli-Syrian artillery exchanges continued Friday afternoon in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These reports could not otherwise be confirmed. Reporters who visited one Israeéli-Syrian flashpoint east of Beirut said the two sides were observing the truce, which apparently was arranged with U.S. help. - The Israeli military command, which reported heavy pre-truce fighting early Friday in which 18 more Syrian MiGs were shot down, said later it had not received reports of post-truce fighting between the Syrians and Israelis.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The-Israeli-Palestinian clashes in southern Beirut continued unabated until nightfall Friday, with Israeli warships cruising offshore joining in the shelling. Israeli aircraft reappeared overhead to bomb and strafe, and Palestinian anti-aireraft bat- teries opened fire on the jets, lighting up the nighttime sky, Beirut reports said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invasion was launched with the stated foal of driving the guerrillas 25 miles back from the Israeli border. But, in six days, the estimated 40,000 Israeli troops lunged 50 miles northward to Beirut’s out- skirts and collided with the Syrian forces that have been in Lebanon for six years as peacekeepers in the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See MIDEAST Page 24  |
