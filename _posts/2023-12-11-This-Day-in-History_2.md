| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A pregnant Texas woman whose fetus has a fatal condition left the state to get an abortion elsewhere before the state Supreme Court on Monday rejected her unprecedented challenge of one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, had spent nearly a week seeking court permission in Texas to end her pregnancy, but her attorneys said she could not wait any longer and left the state. Her baby has a condition known as trisomy 18, which has low survival rates, and her lawsuit argued that continuing the pregnancy jeopardized both her health and ability to have more children.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Texas’ abortion ban makes narrow exceptions when the life of the mother is in danger but not for fetal anomalies. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that Cox had not shown that any of the complications in her pregnancy rose to the level of threatening her life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Her health is on the line.

Blackmun.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling, striking down a Texas law, and a second 7 to 2 decision invalidating key provi- sions of a more modern Geor- gia law, will have an impact in 44 states with similar statutes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blackmun, speaking for the majority, rejected the idea that a pregnant woman has “an ab- solute constitutional right to an abortion on her demand.” But, he said, the decision on wheth- er to end a pregnancy before the fetus becomes viable—be- fore the 24th to 28th week—is one best left to the woman and her personal physician,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first three months, Blackmun said, the decision and the way it is carried out must be left to them. In the sec- ond three months, he said, all the state may do is to regulate the abortion procedures in ways that “are reasonably re- lated to maternal health’ such as making sure they are per-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; formed by licensed doctors and licensed clinics and hospitals.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justice Blackmun said medi- cal data indicates that abortion in the first three months “al- though not without its risks, is now relatively safe.’’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, he said, “any in- terest of the state in protecting the woman from an inherently hazardous procedure ... has largely disappeared.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling followed two years of deliberations by the justices. In other actions the court: —Agreed to review a 1972 New York law providing vari- ous forms of assistance to paro- chial schools and the parents of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children attending them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Rejected an appeal by five Irish-Americans who were held in contempt for refusing to help a and jury in Texas in- vestigate possible weapons shipments to Northern Ireland.  |
