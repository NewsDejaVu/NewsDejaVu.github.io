| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A pregnant Texas woman whose fetus has a fatal condition left the state to get an abortion elsewhere before the state Supreme Court on Monday rejected her unprecedented challenge of one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, had spent nearly a week seeking court permission in Texas to end her pregnancy, but her attorneys said she could not wait any longer and left the state. Her baby has a condition known as trisomy 18, which has low survival rates, and her lawsuit argued that continuing the pregnancy jeopardized both her health and ability to have more children.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Texas’ abortion ban makes narrow exceptions when the life of the mother is in danger but not for fetal anomalies. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that Cox had not shown that any of the complications in her pregnancy rose to the level of threatening her life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Her health is on the line.

Last term it agreed to examine the District of Columbia abortion law which provides even<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; broader grounds. No date for hearing in that case has been set. In each case lower courts struck down the abortion laws as unconstitutional.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District of Columbia statute was declared too vague. But in the Wisconsin case, a special three-judge federal court went much further. It ruled last March 5 that “the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother's interests are superior to that of an unquickened embryo, whether the embroy is mere protoplasm .. or a human being.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribunal in Milwaukee refused however to grant a request of Dr. Sidney G. Babbitz for an _ injunction against enforcement of the law. The opinion said the circum- stances were not exceptional<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to justify interfering<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with state criminal ange That did not prevent panel from handing down its opinion against the law's constitutionality.
