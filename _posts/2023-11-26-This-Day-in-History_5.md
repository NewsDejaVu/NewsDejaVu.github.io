| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next year, the survival of democracy should be the central issue in American politics. To insist on this is to be a realist, not an alarmist. But making that case requires identifying two distinct threats. Need something to talk about? Text us for thought-provoking opinions that can break any awkward silence. ArrowRight The first is Donald Trump, who is already at the center of our national conversation. The second is the ongoing assault on voting rights, which rarely commands the airwaves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s start with the good news: It has become untenable to treat Trump as a normal presidential candidate, thanks to his own evermore radical rhetoric, starting with his pledges to use the Justice Department as a tool for revenge against political enemies. The result is a partial but welcome shift in journalistic coverage recognizing Trump’s journey into what the New York Times called “more fascist-sounding territory.” The Economist, no avatar of left-wing politics, received wide attention ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/26/voting-rights-eighth-circuit-democracy-trump/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/26/voting-rights-eighth-circuit-democracy-trump/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(BY 2H8 essoclieted ress) ASHINGTON, Jan. 25—In a searing denunciation of the administration as faithless to the platform upon which it was elected, Alfred E. Smith gave notice tonight he would “take a walk” during the presidential campaign unless Roosevelt policies are repudiated at Philadelphia.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two recourses open to “disciples of Jefferson and Jackson and Cleveland,” if the New Deal is endorsed in the convention, he teld a cheering Ameri- can Liberty league audience.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We can either take on the mantle of hypocrisy or we can take a walk—and we probably will do the latter,” he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words fell upon the eager ears of foremost mem- bers of both major parties, some of whom had been asking whether the “Happy Warrior” of 1928 might not join an independent party movement ut the expense of the New Deal or possibly support a Republican nominee.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They found he left unanswered whether or not he might seek be- tween now and June to bring about the “reestablishment” of party prineiples he advocated.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There can be only one capital— Washington or Moscow.” he cone tinued with a vigor that flushed his already tuddy cheeks. “The people can breathe the cleat. fresh air of America or the foul breath of So- viet Russia.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers Drown Words<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Tf the constitution wins, we win! The constitution has already won—but the news has noi reached ecrtain ears.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next words were drowned out by cheering and laughter from the crowd which jammed the ballroom of the Mayflower hot. It was in ihe seme room, and before a scene similarly resplendent, that Prest- dent Roosevelt, recently pledged to the Jackson day dinner that "we will not retreat.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and again Smith reverted to the Chicago platform of 1932 which jhe helped draft. Except for stock exchange control and repeal of the 18th amendment, he said, it ha been “thrown in the wustebasket.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mest Intelligent Platform<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Even our Republican friends. and I know many of them; they talk to me freely—we have our little con- Sidences—they have all agreed that it is the most compact, the imost direct, and the most intelligent political platform that was ever put Jorth.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among those who heard the ap- peal on its behalf were John W. Davis, Democratic presidential nominee preceding Smith; and two former Domecretic governors, Els of Massachusetts and Ritchie of Maryland.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ely satd later he could not see *how any Democrat can disagrec with him.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But. an administration leader in the senate, Byrnes of South Caro- lina. expressed regret at home that Smith “cat forget his defeat al the Chicago convention.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Chicago, Smith sought to pre- vent the Roosevelt nomination. There hae been speculation ever<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et ne ae ee  |
