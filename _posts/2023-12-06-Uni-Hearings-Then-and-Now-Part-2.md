| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support for the presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and M.I.T. eroded quickly on Wednesday, after they seemed to evade what seemed like a rather simple question during a contentious congressional hearing: Would they discipline students calling for the genocide of Jews?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their lawyerly replies to that question and others during a four-hour hearing drew incredulous responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s unbelievable that this needs to be said: Calls for genocide are monstrous and antithetical to everything we represent as a country,” said a White House spokesman, Andrew Bates.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Josh Shapiro, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, said he found the responses by Elizabeth Magill, Penn’s president, “unacceptable."<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/us/harvard-mit-penn-presidents-antisemitism.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/us/harvard-mit-penn-presidents-antisemitism.html) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (UPI) - The Senate’s chief investigator of campus riots has accused a university president of applying a "double standard" under which lawbreaking students are immune from criminal laws applied to everyone else.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where do you draw the line?" Sen. John L. McClellan, D-Ark., thundered at Stanford University President Kenneth S. Pitzer. "They commit murder out there—you're going to handle it?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, of course not," Pitzer replied. "But there are categories of things which are technically violations of the law that are better dealt with by campus authorities."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exchange during a Senate hearing highlighted a sharp disagreement between defenders of campus autonomy, who contend college authorities might spark more violence by calling police, and critics who say students have no right to be treated as a special breed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House Tuesday, another aspect of the campus problem reached a climax. A band of Democrats on the House Education Committee managed to kill a bill to cut off federal aid from colleges which did not give the government indications they had plans to handle campus unrest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rep. Edith Green, D-Ore., backer of the measure, said it was a mild step intended to act as a buffer against possible repressive anticampus legislation which might come up from the House floor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But liberal Democrats viewed the measure in the same light as other 'repressive' suggestions and banded together to kill it. Members of the committee disagreed among themselves whether the door would now be open for more stringent attempts at legislation to control student violence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stanford president, testifying Tuesday before McClellan’s investigating subcommittee, said local police agreed to let Stanford mete out academic justice to more than 200 students involved in two building seizures in April. He acknowledged the students smashed windows, damaged machinery, rifled files, and even stole two electric typewriters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But McClellan said it amounted to a "double standard" under which students get a privilege given no one else. "Where there is violence, actual crime, I wonder about the colleges applying the law as they see it," he told Pitzer. |
