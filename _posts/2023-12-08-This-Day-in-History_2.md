| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MEXICO CITY (AP) — When music requires her to cry, Japanese traditional dancer Naoko Kihara barely alters her expression. It’s her arms and torso that move like a slow-motion wave.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Expression is minimal because we cry with our body,” said Kihara, wrapped in her white and navy kimono, on a recent day at her dancing studio in Mexico, where an estimated 76,000 Japanese descendants live.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It is the dance that is speaking, interpreting, since we do not smile, shout or laugh.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kihara won’t reveal her age, but she’s been practicing Japanese traditional dance for almost 24 years. Born in Brazil from Japanese parents who later moved to Mexico City, she carries on the legacy of Tamiko Kawabe, her mentor and pioneer of Hanayagi-style dance in the country.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Latin American audiences, Kihara said, Japanese traditional dance might be hard to embrace.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the fast-moving interpreters of samba and salsa — widespread in Brazil and Mexico — Hanayagi dancers move quietly and gently, performing ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/japanese-dance-hanayagi-naoko-kihara-mexico-569af6b3d719a5b4c58718ec96534ed0](https://apnews.com/article/japanese-dance-hanayagi-naoko-kihara-mexico-569af6b3d719a5b4c58718ec96534ed0) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (® — Some of the young Russians of the Moiseyev folk dance ensemble have learned a lot in three short weeks about how to get around this big city.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They've also learned at least a few things about American life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shopping is a favorite activity among the visiting Russians. To- day at the Claridge Hotel, where they're staying, there were many packages in evidence as groups returned from shopping trips.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Russians are learning about New York’s public eating places by personal experience. Many seem io prefer cafeterias and automats where they can eat quickly, and where they can pick out what they want without need for the English language, which most of them don’t speak.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘the Molseyev dancers are see- ing and doing a lot of things in the limited time they have free from regular morning rehearsals and evening performances, There have been the usual sightseeing excur- sions, visits to museums, motion pictures and the like.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highlights have been attendance in a group at the musical “West Side Story" and a session with American folk dance experts Mi- chael and Mary Ann Herman at the Folk Dance House doing square dances.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their opinions on things Amer- ican are varicd:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“it’s terribly noisy in New York,” sald one of the troupe's leaders holding his head and com- plaining he hasn't been able to sleep well,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your American food tends to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be bland tn our taste.” said an. other Russian. He felt Russiar dishes are tastier and spicier.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i “The dancing in ‘West Side ‘Story’ js very interesting, very and for us it would be onate. We are not used said a girl by the name<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sof Nina.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Russians were enthusi- lastic about “West Side Story’’. Many of the Russians, particu- ‘larly those with some rank in the ‘troupe. tend to stress continually peace and friendship” in their alk with Americans, This is part. ‘ly because they believe in peace and friendship and partly be. cause these are official Soviet slogans,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ The members of the group scem ito be able to go about New York<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freely without supervision when ever they have free time. They almost always are in smal groups. Most of their outings are close to their hotel, of course, since they are already familiar with that district and prefer tc £0 afoot to getting involved wiit taxi drivers who don't speak Rus sian, They spend a good deal ot time looking in store windows,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shopping occupies much of their thought and energy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dancers are not particular- ly communicative about their ideas about things American. There's an obvious general policy not to comment in any detail on their impressions from their visit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they're intensely curious about New York and America. And America is obviously having an impact on them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{  |
