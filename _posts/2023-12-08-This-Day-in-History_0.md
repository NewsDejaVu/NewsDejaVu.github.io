| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOS ANGELES (AP) — Ryan O’Neal, the heartthrob actor who went from a TV soap opera to an Oscar-nominated role in “Love Story” and delivered a wry performance opposite his charismatic 9-year-old daughter Tatum in “Paper Moon,” died Friday, his son said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My dad passed away peacefully today, with his loving team by his side supporting him and loving him as he would us,” Patrick O’Neal, a Los Angeles sportscaster, posted on Instagram.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No cause of death was given.

He was 82.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He died ‘‘peacefully in his sleep,’’ surrounded by friends and relatives, said his agent, Laurence Evans. The cause of death was not given.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was to be buried in a private funeral service, with a public memorial service to be held later, Evans said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knighted, ennobled and uni- versally revered by the film and theater world, he was Lord Olivier when he died, one of the very few Britons to be given a seat in the House of Lords for his acting prowess.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave the world its de- finitive Hamlet, Henry V and Richard III, as well as, at age 76, a matchless King Lear for tele- vision. He set a new standard for film hero in ‘‘Wuthering Heights’’ and embodied the whole painful experience of ag- ing in ‘‘The Entertainer’ on stage and ‘‘A Voyage Round My Father’’ and ‘Brideshead Re- visited’’ on television.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, with ferocious will, he fought cancer, pleurisy and a muscle disease that made even handshakes agony. He endured two mi- serable marriages and years of paralyzing stage fright, con- templated murder and suicide and battled his own rages, guilts and drinking.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Olivier, life and acting were inseparable. ‘‘I have to act to breathe,”’ he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By turns, he loved and hated his craft — but never would contemplate retiring from it. Ac- ting simply consumed him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born May 22, 1907, in the town of Dorking southwest of London, Laurence Kerr Olivier was the third child of an Anglican clergy- man who encouraged him to try acting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After studying acting in Birm- ingham, his first professional role was in 1922 in a sketch ina small touring company. In his first London role, in Alice Law’s 1924 ‘‘Byron,”’ he tripped over a doorsill and fell on his face.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first marriage, to actress Jill Esmond in 1930, produced a son but ended in divorce. Mean- while, his career was soaring through Noel Coward’s ‘‘Private Lives’’ in London and New York, and Shakespeare's ‘‘Romeo and Juliet,’’ in which he and John Gielgud alternated playing Romeo and Mercutio.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olivier played a dazzling suc- cession of Shakespearean triumphs — Hamlet, Henry V, Macbeth. Movie stardom came in 1939 when he moved to Holly- wood and made ‘Wuthering Heights.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that same year, Olivier appeared with Vivien Leigh in a New York production of ‘‘Romeo and Juliet.’’ After nearly two years of clandestine love, he obtained a divorce and the two were wed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That marriage, glamorous in public, was another debacle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They finally were divorced in 1961, and Olivier wed actress Joan Plowright, with whom he finally found happiness.  |
