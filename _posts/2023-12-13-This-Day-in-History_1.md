| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Florida’s state athletic board fined a high school and put it on probation Tuesday after a transgender student played on the girls volleyball team, a violation of a controversial law enacted by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Legislature.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Florida High School Athletic Association fined Monarch High $16,500, ordered the principal and athletic director to attend rules seminars and placed the suburban Fort Lauderdale school on probation for 11 months, meaning further violations could lead to increased punishments. The association also barred the girl from participating in boys sports for 11 months.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2021 law, which supporters named “The Fairness in Women’s Sports Act,” bars transgender girls and women from playing on public school teams intended for student athletes identified as girls at birth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student, a 10th grader who played in 33 matches over the last two seasons, was removed from the team last month after the Broward County School District was not ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/32e563336794f136815a205fc011af26](https://apnews.com/32e563336794f136815a205fc011af26) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRAY, Ga. (‘AP)—A lot of folks in this small middle Georgia town are fighting mad. The school board expelled the county high school’s star halfback because he got married.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank Childs, Jones County School Board chairman, told a special public meeting Wednesday night the board felt it best to ex- pel all married students because “females who get in a family way in school are not a very influence on the other children.”’ He noted the marriage ban first /went into effect in 1960,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  While Childs was on his feet, Mrs. J. R. Cochran, who has a child in school, jumped up and snapped:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You've had your say. Now sit down and let me have mine. If , Castro were doing something like this I could understand it.”’ Charges Discriminating.   She accused the board of dis- ‘criminating against the football ' star, Johnny Arnold, 18, a senior, and other married students. John- ny's wife, 15, a sophomore, also was expelled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ Arnold's mother, Frances Ar- _nold, said she and Johnny's father are separated. She works, Mrs. Arnold said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  “If Johnny doesn't win a schol- ‘arship on his athletic ability, I   guess he won't get a college edu- cation,” she said, ‘‘We cannot af- ford to send him to college on our own.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The board refused to budge from the action it took two weeks ago after learning of the half- back’s marriage. But it said it   would consider at next Tuesday's regular meeting several proposals ‘put forth Wednesday night. Acnly Only te Girls?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ One was that the marriage ban should apply only to girls because as family breadwinner a boy's ed- -ucation is more important. Anoth- er was that married boys should be allowed to continue classes but be barred from athletics and other nonclassroom activities.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ Young Arnold sat through most of the meeting gnawing at his fingernails. He told newsmen he had hoped to be reinstated so he could play in Friday night's game with a Macon school because a University of Alabama scout was supposed to be there to consider him for a scholarship. He said Florida State University also had indicated it might offer a scholar- ship.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray, a town of about 2,.00, is about 80 miles southeast of At- lanta.  |
