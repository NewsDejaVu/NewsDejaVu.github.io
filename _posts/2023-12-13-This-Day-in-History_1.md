| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Kate Cox, whose fetus had a fatal condition, did not qualify for an abortion in Texas: not after four emergency room visits, elevated vital signs, risks of a uterine rupture and with her ability to have more children in jeopardy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Texas Supreme Court’s rejection of the mother of two’s request for an exception under the state’s restrictive ban has laid bare the high threshold women in many states must meet to get the procedure: pregnancy complications that pose life-threatening danger to the mother.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“These laws reflect the policy choice that the Legislature has made, and the courts must respect that choice,” the court’s nine Republican justices said in their ruling late Monday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state’s Republican attorney general had for a week argued that Cox did not meet the standard for an exception, despite appeals from her attorneys that her health was deteriorating.

Bankmeent. WY.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MANHASSET, N.Y. (AP) — A comatose woman on Saturday un- derwent an abortion ordered by her husband in hopes of saving her life, ending a two-week legal fight with anti-abortionists that reached the U.S. Supreme Court.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It's been a major battle. I am tired and wounded. I want to go on with my life,” Martin Klein said shortly after his wife's abortion. “No other family should ever have to go through what we have gone through.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naney Klein, 32, remained com- atose and was listed in guarded<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; condition after the abortion but her vital signs were stable, said spokesman Carol Hauptman of North Shore University Hospital. A team of doctors, including an ex- pert on second-trimester abortions, handled the procedure, she said. Mrs. Klein was 18 weeks pregnant.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We have one other hurdle to overcome, and that is Nancy’s re- covery,” Klein said. “I will live with this decision, but the decision had to be mine.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Klein has been in a coma at the hospital since a Dec. 13 car accident.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein said doctors told him that ‘terminating his wife’s pregnancy could give her a better chance of recovering, so he asked a judge on Jan. 26 to declare him her legal guardian so he could authorize the abortion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a judge granted Klein's request, the ruling was challenged by right-to-life advocates who ap- pealed the decision at each court level until U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall rejected their stay request Friday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein, 34, of Upper Brookville on Long Island, quickly approved the abortion and the procedure was completed Saturday morning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortions have been performed before on comatose pregnant women, but never involving the same type of injury or coma, Ms. Hauptman said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is not only landmark legal terrain but also medical. There's nothing in the medical literature like this,” Ms. Hauptman said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation ended two weeks of strain for Klein and his family.  |
