| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas Supreme Court on Friday night put on hold a judge’s ruling that approved an abortion for a pregnant woman whose fetus has a fatal diagnosis, throwing into limbo an unprecedented challenge to one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order by the all-Republican court came more than 30 hours after Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from the Dallas area, received a temporary restraining order from a lower court judge that prevents Texas from enforcing the state’s ban in her case.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a one-page order, the court said it was temporarily staying Thursday’s ruling “without regard to the merits.” The case is still pending.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“While we still hope that the Court ultimately rejects the state’s request and does so quickly, in this case we fear that justice delayed will be justice denied,” said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Cox.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cox’s attorneys have said they will not share her abortion plans, citing c ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/texas-abortion-ban-supreme-court-decision-10767891a475e7ce2c82b1404450908a](https://apnews.com/article/texas-abortion-ban-supreme-court-decision-10767891a475e7ce2c82b1404450908a) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio’s 132-year-old abortion law was declared unconstitutional today by U.S. District Court Judge Josephy P. Kinneary.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The judge's ruling said the Ohio statute violates the woman's right to privacy which includes the right to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ruling came in a suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio. It sought a temporary and permanent injunction against en- forcement of the law.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suit asked the temporary restraining order to permit a 23- year-old divorced mother of two to have an abortion. It also was on behalf of a Columbus gynecologist, Dr. Harley M. Blank, and all other physicians in Ohio.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The permanent injunction was asked to wipe the Ohio law from the books.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Kinneary said no in- junctions were necessary since the law has been declared un- constitutional.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ACLU suit was filed several weeks ago, soon after the U.S. Supreme Court had declared un- constitutional a Texas abortion statute was similar to Ohio's.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court declared that during the first six months of pregnancy, the decision regarding an abortion is between a woman and her physician. The court said a state could make abortions illegal during the final three months. The ex- ception would be if a woman's life were endangered by the pregnancy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ohio law had stated a legal abortion could be performed only if two physicians certified that a woman's life was endangered by her pregnancy.  |
