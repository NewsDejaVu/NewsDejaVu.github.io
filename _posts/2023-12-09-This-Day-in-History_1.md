| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas Supreme Court on Friday night put on hold a judge’s ruling that approved an abortion for a pregnant woman whose fetus has a fatal diagnosis, throwing into limbo an unprecedented challenge to one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order by the all-Republican court came more than 30 hours after Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from the Dallas area, received a temporary restraining order from a lower court judge that prevents Texas from enforcing the state’s ban in her case.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a one-page order, the court said it was temporarily staying Thursday’s ruling “without regard to the merits.” The case is still pending.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“While we still hope that the Court ultimately rejects the state’s request and does so quickly, in this case we fear that justice delayed will be justice denied,” said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Cox.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cox’s attorneys have said they will not share her abortion plans, citing c ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/texas-abortion-ban-supreme-court-decision-10767891a475e7ce2c82b1404450908a](https://apnews.com/article/texas-abortion-ban-supreme-court-decision-10767891a475e7ce2c82b1404450908a) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DELAND, Fla.
