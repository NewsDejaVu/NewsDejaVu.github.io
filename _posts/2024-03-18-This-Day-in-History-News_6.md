| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON – Special Counsel Robert Hur went before the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday morning to discuss his report on President Joe Biden\s handling of classified documents – and his explosive commentary on Biden\s memory and demeanor. In the report released early last month Hur did not recommend the Justice Department charge Biden with any crimes for the classified documents found in his former Washington D.C. office and Delaware home saying the evidence did not establish his guilt. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/12/robert-hur-joe-biden-congress-hearing-trump-classified-documents/72943194007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (UPI) — Martha Mitchell may be absent from the Senate Watergate hearings but her name comes up frequently as her husband answers questions. Early in his testimony Tuesday John N. Mitchell drew a laugh from the crowded hearing room when he referred to the detailed telephone logs he maintained as attorney general and later as President Nixons campaign manager. You will see that I kept extensive logs he said. All my calls were logged including those of my daughter and my wife. By the way my wife calls a lot more often than my daughter. It was an obvious reference to Mrs. Mitchells proclivity for making phone calls especially to reporters to express her views. At another point Mitchell denied that he had attended a political meeting on the evening of June 28 1972 as a previous witness had alleged. I was in New York on June 28 and I arrived back in Washington early that evening he said and the passenger I had with me was not about to let me attend any more meetings that evening. Under questioning by Sen. Herman Talmadge D-Ga. Mitchell was asked why he resigned as campaign manager July 1 1972 four months before the election. I thought it was the most publicized resignation in history Mitchell told him. I had some long range threats and phone calls that if I didn’t get out of politics I was going to lose my marriage. It had nothing to do with Watergate? Talmadge asked him. None whatsoever Mitchell replied. When Talmadge interjected that he didn’t want to embarrass him about his personal life Mitchell waved him aside. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ATLANTA (AP) — A special prosecutor who had a romantic relationship with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis formally withdrew Friday from the Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump after a judge ruled he had to leave or Willis couldn’t continue to pursue the charges. Attorney Nathan Wade’s resignation allows Willis to remain on the most sprawling of four criminal cases against the presumptive Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-indictment-fani-willis-trump-60b7dd9642fc9ef7c03d75980692334c)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kansas City Feb. 24—Mrs. Chloe G. Albright testified in federal court today that Edson M. Walker a democratic election judge offered to provide her an attorney “who has put his feet under President Roosevelt’s table more times than the president himself.” Mrs. Albright a republican election judge was a government witness in the subornation of perjury trial of Walker convicted last week with another defendant of vote theft conspiracy in last Novembers general election. One of the seven election officials and workers indicted in the Thirteenth precinct Twelfth Kansas City ward Mrs. Albright entered a plea of no defense. She said Walker called at her home after the indictment was returned and “wanted me to change” her account of activities in the precinct polling place as related to an agent of the federal bureau of investigation. “I said: ‘Walker I can’t change my story’” she testified “‘I know it would be perjury.” He replied: ‘If you tell what we want you to tell you have nothing to fear. He said again: ‘We will have plenty of legal talent and all the bonds will be paid.’ I asked him who the lawyers were and he said: ‘Weve got five of the best we can get. One of them has put his feet under President Roosevelt’s table more times than the president himself.’” The name of the attorney was not brought out. Mrs. Willa Mae Shipley a daughter of Mrs. Albright corroborated her mother’s testimony as to Walker’s conversation. The government rested its case soon afterward. Judge Merrill E. Otis conducting the trial said it would take only a few hours. Mrs. Albright repeated testimony she gave in last week’s conspiracy trial saying Walker told her on election day that the votes “are not going to be counted” and quoted him as adding “‘If you force the counting of those ballots we’ll take you for a one-way ride.’” The seven convicted defendants will appear before Judge Otis tomorrow for sentencing. With them will be the four who pleaded no defense. Three others of the 75 indicted since a federal grand jury began its investigation December 14 have been tried but a jury could not agree on a verdict. The defense rested after three questions through which Walker denied Mrs. Albright’s story. Judge Otis allowed 30 minutes for argument by each side and the case was expected to go to the jury late today. |

Michael Ference Jr. Ford vice president for scientific research said the new battery could store up to 15 times as much energy as present lead-acid storage batteries. The firm disclosed Sept. 15 that it was working on the electric car project. Ference said in a prepared statement that Ford Motor Co. and Ford of England have joined forces to build two prototype models of the proposed electric car. The two companies described the new product the first experimental model of which is being built in England now as a low-cost subcompact limited performance city car to carry two adults and two passengers. The first two cars one designed for testing in England and the other in metropolitan suburban areas of the United States will be powered initially by lead-acid batteries such as those now used in Cars. Ference said Ford has developed a new type sodium-sulfur battery which is still in its early stages. He added It promises to meet the over-all needs of an efficient low-cost compact urban-suburban electric vehicle requiring only overnight recharging. Ference estimated that the electric car powered by the new battery would have a range of 150 miles at 40-miles-an-hour |

| Tyson Foods Closing Iowa Pork Plant As Company Moves Forward With Series Of 2024 Closures | Half Of Big Swine Pens Close For Lack Of Receipts; Pork Prices Booming |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 1000 workers at another Tyson Food plant are out of work after the company announced it is permanently closing one of its Iowa facilities. The move comes after the Arkansas-based company closed two chicken plants and announced job cuts last year and said four other plants were expected to cease operations within the first half of fiscal 2024 with related charges − at the time expected to cost the company $300 million to $400 million. On Monday Tyson announced it would shutter the ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/03/12/tyson-plant-closing-perry-iowa/72941284007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicago Aug. 10—Nature’s excessive cooperation with a man made plan for price raising was cited by meat authorities today to account for the present position of pork in the food list. While housewives dug deeper into their purses half of the hog pens in the world’s greatest swine market were closed because the traffic in porkers was at the lowest ebb in the 57 years for which records are available. It was reportedly the first time part of the facilities was closed because of a paucity of receipts. Pork prices have lofted to levels reminiscent of the “boom” era. Retail purchasers paid in some instances four times as much for pork chops as a year ago. Packers paid above $12 for pork the first time in years hogs had hit the $12 mark. The cause was attributed to: 1. The 1934 drought during which farmers got rid of their hogs as quickly as possible to avoid losing them from heat thirst or starvation. 2. The agricultural adjustment act which provided for the destruction of 6000000 piggy sows or grown sows which would have been on the market this year. In addition uncounted prospective litters were destroyed. Receipts at the Union stockyards for the first four days of the week totaled 33600 head of hogs while in the same period a year ago 88631 head were received. The estimated figure for the week is 39000 the fewest on record. To date this year hog receipts amounted to 2229000 head compared with 4045000 hogs received by this date last year. Employment in the yards had fallen to about 200 hog handlers where the average is 700 to 800. A year ago 860 were employed. Pork chop prices to the consumer showed much variation ranging from 17 cents a pound at Des Moines Ia. to 50 cents in Cleveland. Chicago offered chops at 30 cents 10 cents higher than a week ago and four times the price offered at times last year. |

(AP) — Richard M. Nixon renewed his pledge today that a Republican administration would end the war in Vietnam and secure peace in the Pacific. The former vice president said in Manchester N.H. Feb. 28 that President Johnson could end the war before November by a coordinated program of military political economic and diplomatic offensives. If not Nixon said then “a new administration will be elected. We will end the war and we will win the peace.” Resuming his campaign for the New Hampshire presidential primary Nixon said President Johnson has had the worlds greatest power at his disposal but ‘‘never has so much power been used less effectively’’ as in Vietnam. Nixon told a crowd at Hampton’s American Legion hall that the Johnson administration has wasted U.S. military power by using it gradually. He said if the current level of force had been applied more swiftly the war would be over now. In addition Nixon said the administration has failed to use all the diplomatic power at its command to apply pressure for a settlement has not taken steps to increase the determination of the South Vietnamese themselves and has not kept the American people informed. |

| Al Gore Talks Climate Reality Regrets And Hopes For The Grandkids. | Prominent Physicist Predicts Overheating Earth |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an era when mounting disasters made worse by the warming climate raise fears for the Earth’s future Al Gore could simply say “I told you so.” Instead the silver-haired grandfather regrets not pushing even harder to raise awareness during his more than four decades of trying to warn the world about the dangers of climate change. “I guess I could have done more wish I had done more I guess” Gore told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview last week. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/17/al-gore-talks-climate-change-regrets/72959432007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TULSA Okla — One of the nations most prominent physicists believes the earth will become overheated before the end of the 20th century unless nuclear energy is put to work at certain peaceful uses soon. The earth gradually is getting hotter from the increase of carbon-dioxide in the air Dr. Edward Teller told a banquet audience of the Southwest regional meeting of the American Chemical Society Friday night. Teller said accurate measurement has shown an increase of 27 per cent more carbon-dioxide in the air since the beginning of the industrial revolution because of heavy uses of fuel energy such as coal oil and its derivatives. Studies show that when the amount has increased 10 per cent he said the ice caps on the poles will begin to melt and the amount of water on the earth will increase. Such places as New York and Holland would be inundated. While nuclear fuel still has its dangers and limitations it must be put to use in certain large package needs such as the powering of electrical plants in order to reduce the use of conventional fuels that add to the carbon-dioxide content Teller said. Associate director of the University of Californias radiation laboratory Teller has been described by some as the father of the hydrogen bomb. |
