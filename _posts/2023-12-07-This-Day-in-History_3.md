| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — At least three-fourths of Africans can’t afford a healthy diet, and a fifth are undernourished due to an “unprecedented food crisis,” United Nations agencies said in a report released Thursday with the African Union Commission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continent’s 1.4 billion people are confronting high levels of hunger and malnutrition as the hit on world grain supplies from Russia’s war in Ukraine compounds the ills of African conflicts, climate change and the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the report said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It warned that “millions are expected to be at risk of worsening hunger in the near future.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a young population set to double by 2050, Africa is the only rapidly growing region where people are getting poorer, and some are beginning to celebrate coups by soldiers who promise a better life. Despite its wealth of natural resources, Africa is far from meeting its commitment to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2025.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed violence in West and Central Afric ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/africa-un-au-food-hunger-03c66d5afa6b99b2427678faaa87ec56](https://apnews.com/article/africa-un-au-food-hunger-03c66d5afa6b99b2427678faaa87ec56) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON ‘AP) — Agriculture Secretary Earl L. Butz says the world food situation is serious, but not yet at the point where affluent countries need to begin cutting back consumption.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butz disagreed Sunday with several experts who said world food problems represent a crisis. “It is not a crisis,”’ Butz said. ‘It is serious, but it is not a crisis.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butz participated in a panel on world food, broadcast on NBC's ‘Meet the Press,’’ with John A. Hannah, deputy secretary general of the United Nations World Food Conference; Sterling Wort- man, vice president of the Rockefeller Foundation, Jean Mayer, nutritionist at Harvard, and Lester R. Brown, senior fellow of the Overseas Development Council.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They generally agreed all countries must increase food production. Hannah said there are ‘‘about 400 million people<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the world that are not getting enough to eat, either that are actually starving or are getting so little that they don't main- tain good health.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butz said the US. food policy is one of full production. “Governments don't produce food. Only farmers produce food<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and our policy now is one of getting incentives to those farmers so they are going to go for full production.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked if pressure should be put on affluent countries to reduce their food consumption, Butz said, ‘I don't think we are at that point yet.   agreed with Dr. Wortman that the opportunity for in- creased production is tremendous.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Our scientists in the Department of Agriculture have estimated that with present technology we can probably in- crease our feed grain output by 40 to 50 per cent by 1985, wheat by a third, our soybeans by a third, by making more in- vestment in fertilizer which we are doing ...”’ Butz added.  |
