| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A judge in Texas is allowing a woman who is 20 weeks pregnant to get an abortion in a rare case of a pregnant woman seeking a court order for the procedure since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court last year. Keeping up with politics is easy with The 5-Minute Fix Newsletter, in your inbox weekdays. ArrowRight The case involves Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from the Dallas area, who asked the nonprofit Center for Reproductive Rights for legal help in obtaining an emergency abortion in Texas after she learned last week that her fetus had Trisomy 18, also called Edwards syndrome. The genetic condition is one “that cannot sustain life,” as Cox wrote in an op-ed on Wednesday in the Dallas Morning News.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cox’s doctor warned that carrying the pregnancy to term could jeopardize her health and future fertility, including uterine rupture and hysterectomy, according to the lawsuit filed on her behalf.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travis County District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble, an elected Democrat, said  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/07/texas-abortion-judge-ruling/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/07/texas-abortion-judge-ruling/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HARRISBURG (AP) — Terming it clearly unconstitutional, Gov. Shapp has vetoed an abortion control bill that would have required a woman to get her husband’d consent to obtain an abortion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his second antiabortion veto in as many hae Shapp said late Friday night that the husband consent provi- sion violates the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized most abor- tions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ That decision said that abortion is<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strictly a decision between a woman and her doctor through the first three months of pregnancy and the state can- not make laws to interfere.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The attorney general informs me that S.B. 1318 clearly violates the Supreme Court’s decision, and thus the U.S. Constitution, by authorizing hus- bands or parents to force a woman to continue pregnancy beyond the first trimester despite her decision and that of her physician to terminate the pregnancy,” Shapp said in a statement.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1972, two months before the high court decision, Shapp veoted a bill that would have barred all abortions unless the woman's life was in jeopardy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new legislation, passed Thurs- day, attempted to limit availability of abortions as much as sponsors believe the court ruling permitted. Besides husband consent, the bill barred state money to pay for abortions of poor women and required women to give her<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “informed consent” before agreeing to the abortion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill’s prime sponsor, Sen. Charles Dougherty, lashed out at Shapp for his veto. “For the governor of Pennsylvania to refuse to allow a court test to be made .. is to me uncon- scionable, reckless and totally insane,” the Philadelphia Republican said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dougherty said he would attempt an override motion in September, when the legislature returns from a summer recess. The bill passed both chambers this week by more than the necessary two-thirds vote needed to override.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philadelphia Republican said the Supreme Court left unsaid the role of the father in a woman's decision on abortion. “To say that up until the mo- ment of birth I have sathine to say and after the birth ... have responsibility is totally insane. It's a horrible, horrible concept,” he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapp said the bill presented him with “a very difficult choice. I believe in and have consistently supported<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; measures to regulate the conduct of abortions.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said the Helath Department, after holding hearings — will issue new regulations next week intended to protect the health of women during abortion procedures. These regulations, some of which were in the bill he vetoed, include mandatory preg- nancy tests in advance, screening for veneral disease and a requirement that abortions be performed only in hospitals after the first trimester.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his opinion to Shapp, Atty. Gen. Israel Packel said the ban against state aid for low-income women is con- Stitutionally questionable and could result in loss of federal health sub- sidies.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said a provision requiring a woman to be informed of possible detrimental effects “is obviously designed to discourage women from de- ciding to undergo abortions rather than require a full and objective understan-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ding of the procedure.”  |
