| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The View co-host Sara Haines said history should make you feel bad while discussing the state of the country's education on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. As the ABC talk show bemoaned that teaching Black history in the country was under attack in an opening segment co-host Ana Navarro said the issue had been weaponized. To drive people to the polls based on outrage because my poor little White kid is feeling bad because he's learning about slavery. That's ridiculous she said.

Standing before the Lincoln Memorial beside the Potomac on the anniversary of Lincoln’s birth Mr. Johnson said this remains man’s ancient curse and present shame. The true liberators of mankind he said have always been those who showed men another way to live than by hating their brothers. Teacher of Humanity In what he did to lift the baleful burden of racism from the American soul Abraham Lincoln stands as a teacher not just to his people—black and white alike—but to all humanity. Mr. Johnson didn’t depart from his text to mention Vietnam or any other subject. It was a windy cold but sunny day for commemorating Lincoln’s birth in an annual ceremony sponsored by the military order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Standing on the steps of the white marble memorial with its towering columns and the brooding statue of Lincoln within Mr. Johnson said Lincoln often was racked by doubts. But he added the Civil War President’s true quality emerged from the fact that for four long brutal years he never permitted his anguish and doubt to deter him from acting as he felt he should. The President said Lincoln abhorred slavery but his main political objective was to preserve the Union. Once Lincoln settled in his mind that it was necessary to destroy slavery to restore the Union Mr. Johnson said he turned to action. Earlier Lincoln had advocated separate ways for the black and white races Mr. Johnson said and on a practical basis this means support for colonizing free Negroes in Africa and Central America. Ideal Asserted But Lincoln moved with remorseless realism Mr. Johnson said to the conviction that a community of many races should be established. Lincoln died before giving voice to his vision he said and it has taken more than a century for the nation to assert the ideal Lincoln had barely formulated. It has required the hard lessons of a hundred years he said to make us realize as he did that emancipating the Negro was an act of liberation for whites. Abraham Lincoln was the Great Emancipator of black and white alike. In a world long troubled by the curse of racism there is a commanding clarity in Lincoln’s belief that no man can truly live in creative equality when society imposes the irrational spiritual poverty of discrimination on any man. Wind Braces Flag Mr. Johnson was wearing a black suit—no overcoat—during the half-hour of ceremonies in 26-degree weather. A chill wind from the north kept the national and state colors standing straight out from their staffs. He had driven from the White House in a limousine with Mrs. Johnson daughter Lynda and Courtney McPherson the daughter of Presidential Assistant Harry McPherson. The whole party climbed the steps of the memorial and then Mr. Johnson placed a four-foot wreath of red white and blue carnations at the foot of the Lincoln statue. He spoke from the top of the steps looking down over a crowd of several hundred chilled spectators. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all have heard the story about the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. the night before he was killed. How he’d seen the promised land and might not be with us when we got to the mountaintop. It’s important that we remember King incorporated the good Samaritan story into his speech. He was in Memphis to aid sanitation workers who were marching for a livable wage and safe working conditions. He went despite threats to his life and the fact that other civil rights leaders were present to march along ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/14/remembering-martin-luther-king/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bread salesman testified today in the murder trial of three white men that he found nothing wrong with the tires on an ambulance which was carrying the Rev. James J. Reebe to a Birmingham hospital last March. “There was nothing wrong with the tires that I could see”’ Said the witness John H. South of Opelika Ala. and formerly of Selma. The defense produced South’s testimony in its attempt to prove that there was a deliberate delay in taking the injured man to a hospital. Reeb 38 a Unitarian minister from Boston was clubbed fatally on a Selma street the night of March 9. Two companions have testified that their ambulance developed a flat tire and had to be replaced a short distance from Selma. Another prosecution witness described the trouble as a ruptured retread. South was the eighth defense witness called in the first-degree murder trial of Elmer L. Cook 42; Namon O’Neal Hoggle 31 and his brother William Stanley Hoggle 37. The case was expected to go to the jury today. South testified that he trailed the ambulance on its way toward Birmingham and continued to follow when the vehicle turned around and returned to Selma. South testified that the ambulance crawled along at about 10 miles per hour. Another witness service station operator Charles Buchanan said he saw the ambulance pass and estimated the speed at 20 to 25 miles per hour. Earlier defense attorney Joseph T. Pilcher said he would show that some civil rights groups were willing for Reeb to die to make a martyr of the clergyman. A key defense witness was Edgar B. Vardaman whose brother Harry C Vardaman is on the jury of white men. Vardaman testified that he was with O’Neal Hoggle in a cafe across the street when Reeb and two fellow clergymen were attacked. |

| Mlk Jr. Holiday Celebrations Include Acts Of Service And Parades But Some Take A Political Turn | New Holiday ? |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communities across the nation celebrated the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday with acts of service prayer services and parades. But with the November presidential election as a backdrop some events took on an overtly political turn. In King’s hometown of Atlanta several speakers at the 56th annual commemorative service at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church where King served as pastor touched on the divisive partisan climate in the United States.

Humphrey D-Minn. and Sen. Barry Godwater R-Ariz. ‘‘members of a very exclusive club’’ think the United States needs another national holiday—-general election day. The liberal Democrat and conservative Republican —both once ran for president —smiled at each other across the Senate floor Monday after Humphrey in- troduced a measure that would make national holidays out of general election days. The bill would set the first Wed- nesday after the first Monday in November for general elections and it passed 55-21. It was attached as an amendment to the Omnibuus Caopaign Reform bill now under debate. The Senate meets again today at noon and at 4 pm It will vote for the seco..d time within a week on a move to halt debate on the measure which has tied up the senate for more three weeks. Humphrey said the new election date would help br.ng to the polls some of the 51.2 million eligible voters who did not vote in November of 1972 then 37 per cent of the voting age population. He said putting election day in the middle of the week would help avoid a ‘‘fishing day”’ or extended weekend —election day now is on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Goldwater presidential candidate in 1964. spoke from across the room. “T know that what weve been going through the past year ‘Watergate) makes people wonder whats wrong with the political sysem”’ he said ‘Bad politicians are elected by good people who dont vote |

| An Unjust Law Is No Law At All: Mlk’S ‘Letter From A Birmingham Jail’ | Uphaus Says Beliefs Unchanged After Jail |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the nation celebrates Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday today January 15 I predict a new spattering of debates over the legacy of the influential Baptist minister. King gathered a bandied crowd of admirers — and detractors — across the political spectrum in his life and death. Conservative champion Ronald Reagan signed MLK Day into being in 1983. Throughout MLK’s life tensions remained between the Black Panthers and himself as the extremist methods of the former were often contrasted wit ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/an-unjust-law-is-no-law-at-all-mlks-letter-from-a-birmingham-jail/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Willard Uphaus 70 freed from a New Hampshire jail said today his beliefs against tale-bearing or bearing false witness are as strong as ever. The controversial pacifist and former Methodist lay preacher was released unexpectedly from Merrimack County jail in Boscawen N. H. two days before his scheduled departure. Judge George R. Grant Jr. of New Hampshire Superior Court ordered the release at the request of Uphaus attorneys. His wife was on hand to greet him. Uphaus issued a statement shortly after his arrival Sunday night saying he had done the only thing I could honorably have done. He was jailed Dec. 14 1959 for rejecting an official demand for names of those who attended a summer conference of the World Fellowship Center at Conway N. H. Uphaus is executive director of the group. The request was made in 1954 by New Hampshire Atty. Gen. Louis C. Wyman who said he had reliable information that some of the guests at the conference were Communists Uphaus denied this and refused to turn over guest lists. The attorney general started a contempt action. The case dragged through the courts culminating in a refusal by the U.S. Supreme Court to turn down his conviction Uphaus told a newsman that his answer to a similar question now would be no different. Oh yes it will be the same he said. The ground on which I do moral order as the rising and the moral order as the rising and setting of the sun. Uphaus said he will begin making plans soon for another conference of the World Fellowship Center this summer. |

| Not Dei But Mno On Mlk Day | Career Gals Should Remain Lady-Like Expert Advises |

| Roger Clegg for the National Review | News Wire Article published in the Lawrence Daily Journal World |
| January 14, 2024 | June 30, 1965 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For starters I’m not sure we really have to replace DEI with anything. As Ward Connerly once observed when a surgeon removes a cancer we don’t insist that it be replaced with something. Still it seems to be a fact that many people especially politicians don’t want to be just against something: They want to be for something too. And perhaps it’s useful and clarifying for those of us who oppose Diversity Equity and Inclusion to describe our own contrasting vision — especially on Martin L ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/not-dei-but-mno-on-mlk-day/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Career women competing with men for the executive suite would do well to carry no stick save lipstick. And watch your language lady there may be gentlemen present. The advice was from Miss Jo Foxworth in a talk before the national convention of the Advertising Federation of America Tuesday. She is president of the Advertising Women of New York and a vice president and creative director of the New York firm of Calkins and Holden. She presented a code of ethics for the woman who wants to succeed and called it ‘Nine Commandments for Women in Business” as follows: First: Thou shall try harder: thou need not be No. 2. (It is the first order of business to prove to the men that we mean business about our careers). Second: Thou shall know when to zip thy ruby lips and let the men do the talking. (The longer we hold out on the men the harder theyll listen when we do break down and give them the inside straight picture). Third: Thou shall not attempt to hide behind thine own petticoat. Pb cy dont hide’ nearly as they used to. Nowa-  yo ‘re apt to reveal rather more than they conceal). Fourth: Thou shall speak softly and carry no stick save lipstick. (All of us have known the female whose voice under stress’ goes up so many decibels that it could set fire to the fur on a rat’s back). Fifth: Thou shall serve thy lady boss as graciously as thou servest any man. (How can we expect to survive as lady bosses ourselves if we give the girls above us a hard way to go—and keep insisting that wed rather work for men?) Sixth: When success cometh thou shall not get too big for thy bustle. (A man grown too great for his own raiment is hard enough to take but a woman who is too big for her own bustle is impossible). Seventh: Thou shall watch thy language; there may be gentlemen present. (A lot of our current smart talk drifted up to a polite society from the dock walloper but when the girls start bandying it about it’s particularly unsmart). Eighth: Thou shall not match martinis with the men. (Some women can drink some men under the table—but a man under the table can still be dangerous). Ninth: Thou shall save thy sex appeal for after 5. (Sex around the office is like alcohol on the highway). Miss Foxworth added: Anyone who tries to fathom the feminine mystique would be making a mistake. |
