He washed up, called 911 and told the dispatcher what he had done and why he was right to have done it. Keeping up with politics is easy with The 5-Minute Fix Newsletter, in your inbox weekdays. ArrowRight A few years later, when the state of Georgia prosecuted him, a jury found that McElrath was insane at the time — and also, not insane.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jury found him “not guilty by reason of insanity” on the charge of “malice murder,” meaning that he lacked the capacity to distinguish right from wrong or that his delusions meant he lacked criminal intent. But on charges of felony murder and aggravated assault, the jury found him “guilty but mentally ill.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Georgia Supreme Court reviewed the case, it said the conflicting verdicts were so illogical as to be “repugnant” and told prosecutors they could try McElrath again on all three charges.

Trabucco announced that he would pass sentence on the  prisoner Saturday. Jerome Walsh,  Hickman’s chief attorney, sald he ‘would give notice of appeal from the ‘verdict at thet time. The trial was (the first under the new California  law on Hickman's plea that he was ‘not guilty on both charges “by reasan ‘of insanity.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hickman, having confessed his icrimes, and pleaded not guilty by lreason of insanity, and been found  sane by the jury, the court assumed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tence, which will be done The convicted then sat bolt up- oe, eine Gee Sao ae  Jury foreman read his findings. “seemed unperturbed. asinine a pose, Hickman, with his guard at his Mahi, waihed fromm the eine’ seeme aie <a oe, he ee the Cea i wer ese the aiid Ge _alty by nami {\ = life imprisonment ‘for the convicted man, may be =<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closing scenes of the trial   which started January 25, moved rap-   idly. Hickman heard the thunderous ‘philippic of District Attorney Asa A.   Keyes’ denunciation and Judge Trae  bucco took less than 20 minutes to ‘instruct the jurors.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  But One Issue<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keynote of the court’s address was that the sole issue to be decided ‘was whether or not the defendant ‘was sane or insane at the time of the ‘crime.   Judge Trabucco pointed out that   the law refuses to recognize a plea of “uncontrollable impulse.” Further the ‘jury was required to find Hickman sane if it had been shown that he had or has lucid moments. To be adjudg- ed insane, said Judge Trabucco, his mind must have been effected to the extent that he did not know the dife ference between right and wrong. ‘Turning to defense evidence, the court instructed the jurors that a slight preponderance of evidence would be sufficient to warrant a verdict of ine sane. :   Finally, the eight men and four women in the box were told that they should reach their verdict uninflue enced by pity or sympathy for Hick~- man and unswayed by prejudice against him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keyes heaped contempt and scorn on the prisoner, pictured him a calcu- lating, cold-blooded killer actuated by greed for money “rotten to the core’ but sane.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He declared that “it was only to the fact that we are civilized that a mob did not take this man from the offi- cers of the law, and if it were not that I was an officer of the law, f should have wanted to be in the fron§ ranks of such a mob to help put a rope around this man’s neck.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Atrocious Crime<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This defendant has committed the most atrocious crime on record, s@ far as I can find out.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sharp contrast was the quiet,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Continued on Page Fourteen)  |
