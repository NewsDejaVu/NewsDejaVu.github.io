| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Preparing for Hanukkah — Judaism’s celebration of finding light in the darkness — feels uniquely somber yet defiant this year for the diverse Jewish community in Miami-area towns that many consider a welcoming home for their faith.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even here, daily life for many Jews has been upended by the surprise attack on Oct. 7 in Israel, when Hamas militants killed about 1,200, mostly civilians, and by the rise in antisemitism worldwide during the ensuing war, in which more than 15,000 Palestinians have died.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, there’s a sense of dread in South Florida, but also a new sense of purpose for Holocaust survivors and new moms alike, regardless of their politics or religious observance, as they prepare for the holiday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I feel like we’re at war,” said Rabbi Sholom Lipskar, who started the Shul of Bal Harbour more than 40 years ago near the beach in Surfside. But he’s planning a bigger-than-usual menorah lighting for Hanukkah’s start this week.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“God didn’t put us  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/hanukkah-jewish-miami-beach-israel-hamas-war-de06017efbaf1ba0b642356994942ce7](https://apnews.com/article/hanukkah-jewish-miami-beach-israel-hamas-war-de06017efbaf1ba0b642356994942ce7) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That small, faint voice you may have heard above the racket of the cash registers during the Christmas shopping rush was that of an infant hoping to be noticed amid the hurrying crowds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people, if they listened, recognized the voice as that of the Christ Child, the Savior. His birth, His mission on earth, is what Christmas is all about.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many others—of different religious persuasion, or lesser persuasion, or no persuasion—the voice may have had a different source.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was and is present nonetheless, and the message it speaks is the same for all men.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a message that echoes across the ages each year at this season—-a message of hope, of belief in the essential worth of mankind, a rebounding faith that despite all the sorrow men visit upon themselves they are learning little by little how to live in peace with one another.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a message that has been relayed from one disillusioned, frustrated, yet hopeful, generation to another, and will go on being relayed until the allotted time for man on this planet runs out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man today has quite a bit to say about how long or short that time will be. For in this century he has discovered the power that can either reduce civilization to savagery, if not wipe it out altogether, or elevate it to heights undreamed of.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it is not that power that needs controlling. It is man himself, just as it has always been.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the Christmas message is as live and pertinent and hope-refreshing today as it was when it was first heard 2,000 years ago.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There CAN be peace on earth, if men will but have good will. There ARE tidings of great joy, if men will but unclog their ears of the noise and confusion they surround themselves with.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will isten, for a time. For a brief moment, we will believe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we will forget. We will carefully store away the precious, perishable joy of the holiday and again put on the tired old cynicism and selfishness of the everyday world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will forget Christmas—until another year, when its undying message comes ringing back again, as new and fresh and real as ever.
