| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOSCOW (AP) — The suburban Moscow music hall where gunmen opened fire on concertgoers was a blackened smoldering ruin Saturday as the death toll in the attack surpassed 130 and Russian authorities arrested four suspects. President Vladimir Putin claimed they were captured while fleeing to Ukraine. Kyiv strongly denied any involvement in Friday’s assault on the Crocus City Hall music venue in Krasnogorsk and the Islamic State group’s Afghanistan affiliate claimed responsibility.

There were scattered shots early Saturday at the huge Tlateloloco apartment complex but they were believed to have been fired by the occupying army troops who are trying to run down what they insist is the one sniper still active. There was a report that the sniper had been killed but all official sources including the presidential press officer the army the police and the defense department denied that anyone had been hit. The sniper killed one man Friday and the army still was denying it long after the president’s office had announced it and the Red Cross had identified the victim. Three more students died in hospitals of injuries suffered in Wednesdays “night of sorrow” bringing the death toll to 33. Additional hundreds were wounded in the battle at the Plaza of Three Cultures center of the nine-block-square apartment complex. Troops had surrounded a rally of 10000 students who are demanding that the government free what it calls political prisoners when the firing started although no one is sure which side fired first. The troops replied with rifle and machine-gun bursts into the crowd. The government began its raids on homes early Friday evening striking in all parts of the city and the pickups of suspected student leaders continued through the night and all day Saturday. Officials would not say how many had been arrested but observers said that the total might be in the hundreds. The government which gave firm assurances to the International Olympic Committee that it would take whatever measures necessary to assure peace for the games which start Oct. 12 has made no secret of the fact it will intern as many students as it feels necessary |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MADISON Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers signed bipartisan bills Wednesday designed to jump-start creation of an electric vehicle charging network along the state’s interstate system and major highways. The new laws free up nearly $80 million in federal construction aid and makes it easier for gas stations convenience stores and other businesses to operate the electric vehicle charging stations.

Sam Gibbons D- Fia. saying he opposed all such “goodies” as the House worked to complete its energy bill without increased gasoline taxes. The bill also would put quotas on oil imports tax certain business use of fuels and penalize car manufacturers whose fleets fall short of a miles-per-gallon standard. Opponents call it a ‘‘creampuff.”’ The House approved 73- 31 an amendment by Rep. Mike McCormack D-Wash. to provide a credit of up to $750 on the purchase of an electric car. Such cars are now only in the experimental stage. But the amendment was changed to eliminate golf carts from the credit. House members then approved 244-132 a proposal by Rep. Chalmers P. Wylie R- Ohio for a tax credit up to $2000 for the first $8000 spent on installing solar energy equipment in a home. The original bill had a lower amount. McCormack said his amendment “will eliminate the need for many second cars and gas-guzzlers’ by encouraging Americans to buy electric cars for their short errands and driving to work. Gibbons said “I am not against electric cars” but he added There is no way of stopping this once we start it. President Ford met today with congressional leaders to discuss energy and they reportedly discussed the problem “in a conciliatory air.” The House voted Thursday to fine U.S. makers of gas guzzling automobiles beginning in 1978. But it earlier turned down an amendment for a three cents boost in gasoline taxes. Opponents labeled the energy bill a “‘creampuff.’ The bill would put quotas on oil imports tax certain business use of fuels reward conservation with tax breaks and penalize car manufacturers whose fleets fall short of a miles-per-gallon standard. Ford met with bipartisan congressional leaders for the second day in a row and House Democratic Leader Thomas P ONeill Jr. of Massachusetts said “there was no question but there was a conciliatory air.” But the administration has expressed displeasure with the House plan. |

| Rnc Turns Into Personal Piggy Bank? | Reagan Top Fund Raiser |

| March 22, 2024 | January 7, 1976 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump’s new joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee directs donations to his campaign and a political action committee that pays the former president’s legal bills before the RNC gets a cut according to a fundraising invitation obtained by The Associated Press. The unorthodox diversion of funds to the Save America PAC makes it more likely that Republican donors could see their money go to Trump’s lawyers who have received at least $76 million ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/trump-campaign-fundraising-rnc-c0e8f1e7b59f70c5237e13a3462e5790)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — Helped by a law he opposes Ronald Reagan is outpacing President Ford in campaign fund raising. A spokesman said Reagans campaign committee raised about $2 million in private donations during 1975 to finance his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. Ford raised only $1.7 million according to a spokesman for his campaign. Reagan took the financial lead after a late start raising more than $500000 a month during the last quarter of 1975. A spokesman said the heavy pace was continuing into the first days of 1976. Fords pace was $327000 a month for the period. Furthermore three-fourths of Reagans money qualifies to be matched dollar-for-dollar by additional payments from the federal government his spokesman said. Less than one-half of Ford’s money qualifies according to his spokesman. Thus Reagan is getting a boost from the year-old federal election money law which he opposes on philosophical grounds. Whatever Reagan gets he can’t necessarily spend more than Ford because the election law now limits campaign outlays. The spending ceiling is $200000 per candidate in the New Hampshire primary for example. No candidate may spend more than $10 million total to campaign for the presidential nomination of any party. Although incumbent presidents traditionally raise money easily by tapping wealthy donors for big contributions the new law makes it illegal for anyone to give more than $1000 to a single federal campaign. This works to the advantage of a challenger in this case Reagan. By limiting large donations and by providing federal matching money for up to $250 of each private gift the law also places a double emphasis on small donations. This works to Reagans advantage because his strong political views stir strong emotions among his backers who tend to open their pocketbooks more readily than voters in the political middle. “Its more difficult for a moderate to raise money” said Ford campaign spokesman Peter Kaye. Reagan campaign lawyer Loren Smith put it another way. “It (the law) helped us because it put an emphasis. |

(UPI) — What drove Charles Joseph Whitman mad? Could it have been detected? A brain tumor the size of a pecan his parents’ separation the strain of his studies hostility toward his father a mass killing in Chicago a month before the one he committed Monday—all were suggested as pieces of the puzzle. But no one really knew. Despite an ominous reference to thoughts of “shooting people” from the University of Texas tower—a thought Whitman turned to action Monday— a psychiatrist who examined him four months ago said he looked like an all-American boy —and anything but a psychopath. The psychiatrist Dr. Maurice Dean Heatly talked to Whitman at the university student health service last March for two hours. The ex-Marine made an appointment to come back again but broke it. Heatly said the 25-year-old student told him he was “thinking about going up on the tower with a deer rifle to start shooting people.” But he said it seemed a “transient thought.” “It was sort of like saying ‘I got so mad that I could do something’’’ Heatly said. Nevertheless it was the only direct quote he put in his notes from the interview. Heatly said Whitman was “oozing with hostility’ and enmity toward his father who had separated from his mother a month earlier. He said Whitman accused his father of being brutal and domineering and also confessed having beaten his own wife on two occasions. Theories came from several quarters. Whitman’s father C. M. Whitman of Lake Worth Fla. said his son drove himself to the breaking point in his studies. Texas Gov. John Connally arriving in Miami after cutting short a trip to South America said he thought the recent slaying of eight Chicago student nurses may have triggered the sniper massacre. Medical experts said they doubted a pecan-sized tumor found at the base of Whitman’s brain could have prompted the murder spree. Dr. Daniel Ruge a Chicago neurosurgeon said there was no question that brain tumors can cause personality changes “but I’ve never heard of them causing violence.” |

| Ukraine Aid Has Stalled In Congress But A Trump-Backed Plan Is Picking Up Steam | Angola Aid Plan In Need Of Miracle |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As aid to Ukraine has stalled in the halls of Congress interest is growing in the idea of delivering funds to the war-torn nation as a loan a proposal first floated by former President Donald Trump. Several powerful Ukraine advocates are still pushing the House to take up the $95 billion spending package the Senate passed in February with bipartisan support. It’s stuck in the lower chamber with hard-right opposition stopping its advancement. That bill would send $60 billion to ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/20/ukraine-aid-congress-trump-gop-democrats-russia/73047397007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — It would take a miracle to persuade Congress to go along with President Fords plan for aid to Angola House Speaker Carl Albert says. The Senate has written into a $112-billion defense appropriation bill a ban on using funds in Angolas political and military struggle where the United States has been backing two factions and the Soviet Union has been supporting a third group. The White House has said Ford will urge that the prohibition be lifted. He is scheduled to make his State of the Union address Monday. But Albert who heads the Democratic majority in the House said in an interview ‘I think it would be a miracle if the White House could put through the Congress any kind of assistance for the Angola proposition.” On the contrary Albert added ‘I think almost any kind of a bill keeping us out of there completely out financially as well as physically would probably pass the House .”’ Referring to the Ford administration he added “They havent made themselves clear they havent told anybody what they are going to do that I know of.” Albert said average U.S. citizens “dont want to do enough to do the job. The Russians are not going to let us do enough to do the job. ..To do the job we would have to have a confrontation with Russia which we are not willing to have over that I think.” Albert said the events which placed the United States on the same side as South Africa in the Angola matter “give Russia what it wants in the way of having ...a base of strong feeling coming out of most of the continent of Africa. Whether it is merited or not it is a fact.” The speaker said he considers himself “one who generally supports bipartisan foreign policy.” But he added ‘This is one that is so far removed and so remote and the basis of which is so hard to see that I just dont think the House will go along with it ...not unless they do a lot better explaining than they have up to now. I just cannot see this possibly going through.”’ Albert said there would be no political advantage to be gained by blaming on for rejecting Fords Angola plans. |
