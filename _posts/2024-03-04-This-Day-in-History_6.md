| Mcconnell To Step Down | Leadership Fight Begins As Mansfield Retirement Opens Top Democratic Senate Post |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — Mitch McConnell the longest-serving Senate leader in history who maintained his power in the face of dramatic convulsions in the Republican Party for almost two decades will step down from that position in November. McConnell who turned 82 last week announced his decision Wednesday in the well of the Senate the chamber where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front row seat afforded the party leader. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/mitch-mcconnell-senate-republican-leader-stepping-down-ba478d570a4561aa7baf91a204d7e366)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (UPI) - Mike Mansfields announced retirement has triggered what could be a bitter Democratic battle for the power and prestige of the senate leadership he has held longer than anyone in history. The contest for Democratic leader will coincide next January with a Republican battle over replacing GOP leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania who also retires at the end of this year. The anticipated upheavals could even reach across the Capitol into the House of Representatives where Speaker Carl Albert has not yet decided whether to seek another term. The contests are expected to sharply underscore and perhaps aggravate deep conservative and liberal divisions within both parties. Only hours after Mansfield revealed his decision not to seek re-election Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine formally declared his candidacy for the job which becomes vacant in January. Muskie’s candidacy pits him against assistant Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia who has made no secret of his ambition to succeed Mansfield and who is generally considered to have the inside track. Assistant Republican leader Robert Griffin of Michigan wants Scotts job but may be challenged for the post by the more conservative Sen. John Tower of Texas chairman of the Senate GOP Policy Committee. If either Griffin or Byrd steps up their No. 2 posts will of course be up for grabs. Byrd won his assistant leadership post in a close upset over Sen. Edward Kennedy in 1971 after years of meticulously courting his colleagues and mastering Senate rules and procedures. He has since won the approval of his colleagues for his sheer hard work with Mansfield virtually delegating the Senates day-to-day routine operations to him. But close Senate observers say Byrd by no means has it wrapped up. In the end his conservative political past including membership long ago in the Ku Klux Klan may be his undoing. Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota also would like to cap his long political career with the leadership post. He has been at times highly critical of the lack of leadership in Congress. |

| Michigan Primary Could Reveal Significant Political Perils For Biden Trump | Backer Of Lbj Policies Wins In Oregon Primary |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEARBORN Mich. (AP) — President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump won the Michigan primaries on Tuesday further solidifying the all-but-certain rematch between the two men — yet early results from the state were highlighting some of their biggest political vulnerabilities ahead of the November general election. A vigorous “uncommitted” campaign organized by activists disillusioned with Biden’s handling of the war in Gaza was making headway. It had already far surpassed the 10000-vo ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-election-michigan-2024-6e0b9fc18773e975fdfd23f7287ed615)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert B. Duncan President Johnson’s champion in an Oregon campaign focused on Vietnam captured that state’s Democratic Senate nomination amid Republican talk of nationwide voter uneasiness about the Asian war. In Duncan’s runaway victory Tuesday over peace candidate Howard Morgan advocates of the U.S. stance in South Vietnam could find at least a partial answer to the Republican report. Duncan a two-term congressman and Morgan a former member of the Federal Power Commission stood together on domestic matters. They argued only about Vietnam. Morgan called U.S. involvement there a tragic error; Duncan said it is necessary. Their clash echoed the debate that has raged in Congress and on campuses across the nation. In Oregon for the first time the voters judged the debaters. With 1437 of 2946 Oregon precincts reporting Duncan had 64 per cent of the votes Morgan 33 per cent and a third candidate 3 per cent. Voters rendered their judgments in primary elections in Florida Oklahoma and Kentucky too. The most startling decision in the balloting was Miami Mayor Robert King High’s rematch triumph over Florida Gov. Haydon Burns. High’s upset climaxed a bitter runoff campaign which produced Burns charges that the short red-haired mayor was the candidate of a Negro bloc and a protege of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy D-N.Y. High said he was campaigning for integrity in government and accused Burns—who overwhelmed him two years ago — of cronyism and patronage that cost millions of dollars. In other major races: —Republican Sen. John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky won renomination without serious opposition. John Young Brown a college classmate former congressman and Senate rival 20 years ago easily won the Democratic Senate nomination. —Preston Moore of Oklahoma City former national American Legion commander blunted the comeback bid of former Gov. Raymond Gary and won the Democratic nomination for governor of Oklahoma. State Sen. Dewey Bartlett of Tulsa won the Republican gubernatorial nomination over John N. Happy Camp. —Republican Pat J. Patterson outdistanced Don Kinkaid who had solicited John Birch Society backing for the nomination to challenge Oklahoma’s Democratic Sen. Fred R. Harris in November. —Former Rep. M. G. Snyder of Kentucky was nominated for the House from the newly designed 4th District topping two rivals in a race that renewed the Republican split of 1964. Snyder a conservative fought for the cause of Barry Goldwater two years ago and lost his House seat in the Democratic landslide. Moderate and liberal Republicans in power in the Louisville area lined up against Snyder calling him an extremist. Snyder won easily. He faces State Sen. John Moloney of Covington in November. —Secretary of State Tom McCall won the Republican gubernatorial nomination in Oregon. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to Fox News’ Artificial Intelligence newsletter with the latest AI technology advancements. IN TODAY’S NEWSLETTER: - These major companies are using AI to snoop through employees’ messages report reveals - SEC reportedly investigating OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s communications - AI used by US forces to help identify hostile targets in Middle East: report WATCHING WORKERS: Several companies including Walmart Delta T-Mobile Chevron and Starbucks are now reportedly monitoring employees ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/fox-news-ai-newsletter-companies-snoop-employees)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — One of the Labor Departments biggest headaches is machines taking over the jobs of men. It has shown its concern—with funds and training programs—for the flesh-and-blood workers who bowed out of the way by robot contrivances that clink and clank in mills and mines offices and fields. Now suddenly the department seems to have cast its lot with the robots. It has installed one as a press agent. By so doing it has put automation in the field of public relations which legend holds is a crisis-ridden high-pressure breeding ground for ulcers and migraine headaches. Perhaps the Labor Department feels it will serve the robot right. Whatever the motive when a reporter now dials the department to learn whats new on the labor field he gets a crisp no-nonsense guide from a recorded voice. If you ring now for instance you will be told that a meeting on a labor dispute will be held Monday that Secretary of Labor Arthur J. Goldberg will make a dedication speech Monday night and that theres a press release for Tuesday morning papers urging teenagers to return to school. The department admitted some misgivings about the venture. In a memorandum to Washington editors and reporters it carefully labeled the innovation an experiment. The voice on the first recording belongs to Miss Bess Friedman an attractive and apparently cautious young lady who isnt staying around to see how the robot works out. She got away on a vacation. |

IN TODAY’S NEWSLETTER: - Natalie Portman says AI could put her out of a job soon: ‘There’s a good chance - Google Gemini backlash exposes comments from employees on Trump ‘antiracism’ and ‘White privilege’ - Dont think of our AI future as humans vs. machines. Instead consider these possibilities OUT OF A JOB: Natalie Portman has some mixed feelings about artificial intelligence. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/fox-news-ai-newsletter-natalie-portman-worries-replaced)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt and Miss Frances Perkins secretary of labor girls and women unemployed and unmarried from 16 to 45 years of age will have an opportunity to enter camps and earn a living until times improve. Some women who applied past 50 and not eligible “wept bitterly.” For women at 50 the world does the least and should do the most. Commander Frank Hawks flying from Los Angeles to New York “non-stop” is sitting quietly hands idle watching a “robot pilot” run the machine. Twenty-five years ago few would believe that airships could ever really fly. Suppose you had suggested that they would fly piloted and controlled by a “robot” or artificial man. What would have been said? Men can do whatever they can imagine and many things more. Yesterday was the “maddest merriest day of all the glad new year” 1933 in Wall Street. Stocks rose from one to ten dollars a share. “Big steel” really began to be big once more passing $34 a share. Only a little while ago poor old “big steel” was drifting around $25 a share and lower. It is the solemn truth that “hope is stronger than memory.” And think of the happy smiling faces of brokers when they saw stocks selling for a while at 3000000 shares an hour with total sales for the day 6500000 shares. Sorrow is in the hearts of those that sold their stock exchange seats too cheap and hope is reborn for those that predicted seats at $1000000 each. The Associated Press says “the navy department has ordered greater ‘rake’ and ‘flare’ in enlisted men’s caps.” They must have the “required rake in the crown” and the sides must be “padded to give the required flare.” All that is intensely satisfactory. Words cannot express our joy learning that our enlisted men will no longer wear caps which lack rake and flare. That being settled perhaps those in charge of government defense will look into the matter of airplanes and get a little more “rake” in that direction. That would be appreciated. Various straws tell you that the wind of change is blowing away depression. Lawrence P. Fisher president of General Motors and head of the Cadillac company announces that Alfred P. Sloan jr. head of General Motors has authorized a 5 percent wage increase which affects 100000 employees of the company. This partial restoration of previous wage reductions will be welcome to the men. It is to be hoped that the example set by Mr. Sloan in General Motors will be followed by other industrial concerns wherever earnings make it possible. All newspapermen and the whole country will learn with regret of the very serious illness of Cyrus H. K. Curtis who is 83 years old and said to be “very ill. |

An annual survey led by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) of the recognizable species wintering in central Mexico found the second-lowest number of monarchs on record.

Vacationers along U.S. 89 near McCloud report the butterflies settle across the highway in clouds. The butterflies began appearing in hordes about five weeks ago. They are identified by local naturalists as monarchs regal fritillaries queens buckeyes red admirals American coppers and common wood nymphs. They hatch in the forests on 10437-foot Mt. Shasta. |

The Pope ran a slight fever and canceled his weekly general audience on Wednesday. He did bless the crowd from his study however. |
