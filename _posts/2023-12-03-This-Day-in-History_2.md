| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — With Planet Earth running a fever, U.N. climate talks focused Sunday on the contagious effects on human health.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a brown haze over Dubai, the COP28 summit moved past two days of lofty rhetoric and calls for unity from top leaders to concerns about health issues like the deaths of at least 7 million people globally from air pollution each year and the spread of diseases like cholera and malaria as global warming upends weather systems.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it’s high time for the U.N. Conference of Parties on climate to hold its first “Health Day” in its 28th edition, saying the threats to health from climate change were “immediate and present.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Although the climate crisis is a health crisis, it’s well overdue that 27 COPs have been and gone without a serious discussion of health,” he said. “Undoubtedly, health stands as the most compelling reason for taking climate action.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/climate-health-ab2a64170501124239db9efaf11d3f77](https://apnews.com/article/climate-health-ab2a64170501124239db9efaf11d3f77) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DORADO, Puerto Rico (UPI) — President Ford, delivering an analysis of the world’s most recent economic downturn, has urged Western leaders to set more “realistic’’ social goals to hold down inflation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford and the leaders of six other nations attending the Economic Summit Conference were to hold two more sessions today on _ subjects ranging from trade and north-south relationships to energy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. officials hosting the two-day conference at this tropical resort on the Atlantic Ocean said the mood at Sunday’s opening session was one of “determination, confidence and joint responsibility.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other nations participating were Great Britain, France, Ger- many, Italy, Canada and Japan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talks have been freewheeling and dealt from the outset with economic recovery and monetary issues.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Greenspan, Ford’s chief economic adviser, said the President told the other leaders recession and joblessness were caused by a decade of persistent inflation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenspan said Ford expressed his own long-held view that the United States and other governments had over-extended themselves in the drive to right social wrongs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global inflationary climate came about in large part, Ford said, because ‘‘sovernments over: committed themselves to amelioriate social inequities at home and abroac and to achieve rising standard of living,’’ Greenspan told reporters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“These commitments proved to be in retrospect, in economic terms, toc ambitious in what they actually; achieved as well as expectations they raised, and as a consequence, the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; major task of the next several years is both economic and political to re- store the economy to a sustained growth pattern but also to accept realistic goals that are accepted by the public as a whole.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenspan said Ford did not specify any country in criticizing government spending for social programs but he has opposed U.S. ‘‘Great Society”’ ao. in the past because of the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avy federal spending involved.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford said “inflation by itself creates recession and unemployment<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.. and the way to cope is to eliminate inflation,’’ according to Greenspan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime ministers Aldo Moro of Italy and James Callaghan of Great Britain told the summit their economies needed more time before economic brakes are applied by the stronger nations, chiefly the United States, West Germany and Japan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau told the conference the differing rates of recovery from the worldwide recession were a blessing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that if all the nations had synchronized rates of growth all could go boom or bust at the same time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French President Valery Giscard D’Estaing said France also has an unemployment problem but curbing inflation was a more urgent priority.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also attending were Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany and Prime Minister Takeo Miki of Japan.  |
