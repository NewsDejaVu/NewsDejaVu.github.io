| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to choose to and then have an abortion has changed the course of three generations of my family. It has been inextricably linked to my immigration story and foundational to my ability to become a mother. And last year I helped a teenager access an abortion who was living in a state without abortion access. She was part of my chosen family and was the reason friends and strangers in my life came together to confront the many challenges of navigating ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2024/06/24/abortion-laws-post-roe-america-access-healthcare/74004664007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HONOLULU (AP) — Sandra is a pretty petite 15-year-old brunette with soft brown eyes and hair that flows over her shoulders to her waist. She lives in a five-bedroom ocean-front house on nearby Maui Island where she spends her time swimming camping and studying such school subjects as mathematics and sociology. Her doctor says she can expect her baby July 9. You get pregnant and everybody thinks of you in a different way—like youre dirty Sandra—not her real name— said in an interview My mother told me to have an abortion. The hospital told me to have an abortion But I didn’t want to kill my baby. For saving her baby Sandra credits the family of Robert J. Pearson a building contractor who lost his antiabortion fight in the state legislature when Hawaii became the first state to make abortion legal and available practically on request. In the first year after the law went into effect March 13 1970 there were 3643 abortions in Hawaii and unlike in New York there is no substantial movement here to repeal the law. But Pearson has continued his fight by inviting women contemplating abortion to travel to live and continue their educations at his 4.5-acre residence until they have their babies—all at no expense. Pearson and the antiabortion foundation he incorporated even pay for prenatal and delivery expenses. There are no obligations no strings attached. We just want to show the girls there are alternatives to having abortion Pearson said adding that the women learn of his home through doctors relatives and social agencies. Pearson estimates his fight has cost him personally some $20000 but he plans an even larger investment—a $200000 home accommodating 100 women. It will include recreation rooms and facilities for developing such skills as typing and shorthand as well as academic training—We want to help them get back on their feet he said. At the home which now can handle 20 girls Pearson provides a full-time nurse. Of the 80 women ranging in age from 14 to 36 who have lived with them Pearson says only one has decided to go through with an abortion a decision he says is left up to each girl. About 10 per cent of the girls keep their babies while the others put them up for adoption Pearson said. Sandra is in the latter group and plans to return alone to her mother and stepfather after having her baby. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will plead guilty to a felony charge in a deal with the U.S. Justice Department that will allow him to walk free and resolve a long-running legal saga that spanned multiple continents and centered on the publication of a trove of classified documents. Assange left a British prison on Monday and will appear later this week in the U.S. federal court in the Northern Mariana Islands ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/assange-plea-deal-wikileaks-justice-department-d329ba4614dbfa77b5eb968d07fd9bd0)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Earl Ray quoted as wishing now he had elected to stand trial for the Martin Luther King assassination was joined in his regrets today by the U.S. Justice Department. A source in the department said the feeling there over Ray’s abrupt guilty plea is one of frustration. The reason: a full-fledged trial had one been held might have shed light on questions which have led to widespread suspicion around the country that Ray was only one figure in a conspiracy. In Nashville the Nashville Tennessean said in a copyright story that Ray disclosed second thoughts about the guilty plea within hours of his sentencing in Memphis to an agreed 99 years in prison. Ray also has inquired about how he could hire a new attorney. The story said unidentified official sources quoted Ray as saying: When I went to court Monday I was convinced if I didn’t plead guilty I was going to the electric chair. I wish the hell I hadnt now because with what they had on me I believe the worst I’d gotten would have been life. Under Tennessee law a life prisoner could be eligible for parole after 13 years 7 months or even earlier if he earned maximum good behavior time. Under a 99-year sentence a prisoner must serve at least 30 years. The Tennessean said a prison source further quoted Ray: My attorney and my brother told me about six weeks ago that the best thing for me to do was to plead guilty if we could work out a deal to keep me out of the chair. They told me they thought this could be done. I was thinking about it and every day they thought I would plead guilty. Last week I just told them if they thought this was best and what I ought to do then I would plead guilty. |

We have got to see if we can find out what the difficulty is said Chairman Brewster (R-Me) of the Senate commerce committee in announcing he has summoned the Civil Aeronautics Board to a committee hearing today. Both Brewster and Senator Capehart (R-Ind) committee member said a government air safety board might be proposed to take over crash investigation work now done by CAB. Committee work was all that was on todays schedule for the Senate which is in recess until Wednesday under its program of three sessions weekly. The House was to ratify formally Republican committee assignments okayed by GOP members in caucus yesterday. Democrats expect to finish their assignments Wednesday thus completing House organization. Republicans are taking 280 places on the 19 committees leaving 205 for Democrats. The Republican caucus formally approved the appointment of Rep. Arends of Illinois as whip. The nomination of Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt to the United Nations’ Human Rights Commission is among diplomatic appointments of President Truman up for consideration today by the Senate foreign relations committee. Senator Morse (R-Ore) differed sharply with his partys proposed labor policy asserting that perfecting the Wagner Act should come first. In a radio talk last night he asserted: If the Republicans continue their anti-labor policy and their fiscal policies which will lead to fiscal isolation they will lose both Congress and the White House in 1948—and they will give us the worst era of labor unrest in our country. |

(AP)— A resort to the courts for punishment of employers violating collective bargaining provisions of industrial codes today was promised workers by William Green president of the American Federation of Labor. In a Labor day appeal for support of the Roosevelt recovery program the federation leader said he was ‘‘confident that more than a million new members have joined us.” He described the NRA as opening “the door of opportunity for industry and labor.” Green spoke under the auspices of the Akron Central Labor union. He said “a new deal has been ‘accorded industry and labor.” “In all fairness” he said “‘industry could not expect to appropriate to itself the benefits of the national recovery act and deny to labor the benefits which were accorded it. If industry is permitted to organize and control business labor likewise must be permitted to organize for mutual helpfulness and protection. And labor that very thing. * * * “If an employer discriminates against employees who organize or discharges them because they organize he is guilty of violation of the code and is subject when convicted to the imposition of penalties provided for in the national recovery act. “It is the purpose and intent of the American Federation of Labor to protect workers in the exercise of their rights to organize and to invoke punishment through proper court procedure upon these employers who are charged with and found guilty of violating the law. |

(AP) — Development appears feasible for electronic computers that would predict human behavior — including how people would vote in an election — a psychiatrist said today. The trick could be done if enough brain power — and money —were put into a “crash program designed to perfect data-feeding and other techniques needed to activate such robots declared Dr. Daniel Cappon of the University of Toronto. Such an achievement could advance psychiatry by half a century he said in a report to the 122nd annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. Cappon said he is convinced the goal is feasible on the basis of his own use of a computer for the past five years as an aid in psychiatric research. He said he has used it on such things as rapid calculation of experimental results and as a means of information storage and retrieval. And most recently in promising experiments aimed at translating entire psychiatric histories into a relatively simple “computer language.’ “There is no reason why he said ‘once data incorporating the life experience and mental state of persons — such as patients and controls — is put into computers this could not be subsequently tapped to answer questions about how people might behave under certain circumstances for example under conditions of stress of treatment or in casting a vote “If enough information is stored — and if the computer yields sufficient criteria to be subsequently reprogrammed it should be possible to ask computers on behalf of the population they represent to make decisions between alternate futures and thus enhance the predictability of human behavior. |

General Motors Corp. Chrysler Corp. and American Motors Corp. also are known to be working toward an electric power system or other means of propulsion. Fords Arjay R. Miller made his disclosure in a speech Thursday at the University of Michigan while discussing air pollution and its relation to todays gasoline-powered cars. Speaking of automobiles and their exhaust pollution Miller said at one point: The ideal answer to this problem would be development of a vehicle powered by a source that would not produce any emissions. The most promising candidate at present appears to be a battery-powered electric car. We now have in the early stages of development a new battery power system that we expect could offer tremendous improvements in range performance and cost. Eventually we hope it will lead to a practical emission-free vehicle for local transportation needs. Miller was unavailable to newsmen today but a Ford spokesman said it was safe to assume local transportation needs precluded use of battery power for long-distance trips in the next few years at least. The industry has been experimenting for years with electric power as an energy source for automobiles but power-to-weight ratio has proved a major handicap especially in development of a battery to provide quick acceleration. |

She was so kind to the youngsters she didn’t even want to spank them. She always had the house spic and span when I came home at night. She just couldn’t have been in her right mind when she did that to the baby. Just four days ago she told me she was afraid she was going to have a nervous breakdown. She said she just knew something was going to happen. At the hospital this morning she kept asking me Are they going to doctor my mind? |

(AP) — Thousands of Mexican nationals are being smuggled into California in a lucrative and lethal trade that operates despite federal lawmen with electronic eyes and stiff court penalties. The Mexicans lured by better paying jobs are crossing the border illegally by foot car truck plane and boat. The U.S. border patrol arrested 63933 deportable aliens in California last year. At the Chula Vista sector south of here the number of deportable aliens nabbed jumped from 4377 in 1963 to 41597 last year. It can be a deadly experience for the alien. Weve had about a dozen deaths since the first of the year involving illegal aliens U.S. Atty. Harry Steward said. Five Mexicans were killed early Friday when a truck being pursued by Border Patrol officers crashed near Descanso in southeastern San Diego County. Another alien was shot recently when he ran from guards at the Camp Pendleton Marine Base. Others have died of exposure or falls from cliffs while trying to hike over mountains and deserts of southeastern California. I don’t know of any crime killing as many people around San Diego Steward said. And many aliens are found near death from suffocation in trunks of cars. Border patrolmen said a major smuggler may make $1 million a year. We prosecuted a $300000-a-year operation last year said Steward whose district covers the border counties of San Diego and Imperial. They come to get jobs at farms factories restaurants hotels and in homes as domestic workers. Most go back to Mexico after they’ve earned some money. If caught a smuggler faces five years in prison and $5000 fine for each alien involved. |
