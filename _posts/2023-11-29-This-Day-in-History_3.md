| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) — President Joe Biden used a backdrop of the world’s largest facility for wind tower manufacturing to sharpen his criticism of Republicans Wednesday, saying the company’s expansion validates an environmental agenda his political opponents want to undo.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company that Biden visited, CS Wind, is on the home turf of Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who has described the president’s climate policies as “a massive failure.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Did you all know that you’re part of a massive failure?” Biden said to the workers and local officials gathered for his speech as he touted hundreds of new jobs fueled by tax incentives for clean energy initiatives. “None of that sounds like a massive failure to me. How about you?”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biden’s rebuttal to Boebert was fresh evidence of the Democratic president’s intention to more aggressively push back against what he calls “MAGA Republicans.” He has been struggling with low approval ratings, and Democrats are anxious for him to gain ground politicall ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-boebert-colorado-republicans-0edd0c6f25fe17edd92f8c80b0488f89](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-boebert-colorado-republicans-0edd0c6f25fe17edd92f8c80b0488f89) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PITTSBURGH (AP) — President Reagan, taking his pitch for high technology job retraining amongst a sea of unemployed steelworkers, ran into one of the largest protest demonstrations of his presidency Wednesday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a tour of the Control Data Institute, where 125 jobless steelworkers are being trained to repair com- puters, Reagan spoke to the National Conference on the Displaced Worker while thousands stood outside in a cold rain waving signs and chanting. ;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Reagan, Reagan, he's no good. Send him back to Hollywood,” they said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the banners: ‘“Reagans Friends Get Tax Breaks. Steelworkers Get Pink Slips.” And: “Buck Stopped Here When Ronald Reagan Took Office.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president, whisked into the hotel through an underground garage, could see only a smattering of the crowd, which police estimated at 3,500.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he acknowledged that he was in hostile territory when he departed from his text to say, “I come to you not only as a speaker but as a possible victim.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noted that many at the bipartisan gathering<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; might like to see him dislocated from his job.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘We as a nation owe an obligation as well as a help- ing hand to those who pay the price of economic read- justment,” the president said in the prepared part of his speech. ‘Government — federal, state and local — should provide support for job training and re- employment assistance.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anger and skepticism were evident in the computer classroom as well as on the street outside the con- ference hotel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Control Data, several of the students, most of whom had lost jobs in the steel mills, asked Reagan if they were wasting their time retraining for jobs that might not exist by the time they finish their training in several months.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man who identified himself as Ron Bricker ap- proached Reagan after the president's brief remarks, handed him a resume and said, ‘I’ve been looking for a job for a year and can’t find one.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reagan took the resume and shook the man’s hand, telling a corporate executive afterward that Bricker was ‘typical of the kind of person we want to help.”  |
