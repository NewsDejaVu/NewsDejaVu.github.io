| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid a growing advertiser exodus over antisemitism on his social media site, Elon Musk told advertisers he doesn’t want their money — in no uncertain terms. “Go f--- yourself,” Musk said at the New York Times DealBook conference Wednesday, addressing the growing list of advertisers who have stopped spending money on X, formerly Twitter, over concerns that Musk himself was amplifying antisemitism and racism on the social media site. He appeared to specifically call out Disney chief executive Bob Iger, whose company is among those who paused advertising on X, saying, “Hi, Bob.” Iger had spoken earlier at the conference, but it was unclear if he was still in the room when Musk spoke.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What this advertising boycott is going to do is to kill the company,” Musk said before a crowd of business executives and journalists gathered at the Lincoln Center in Manhattan; the conference was also streamed live online. If X does go bankrupt, the public will blame censorious advertisers, not him or his ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/29/elon-musk-advertiser-dealbook/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/29/elon-musk-advertiser-dealbook/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOSCOW (#—Sovet newspapers have found three new targets for their ire—advertising writers, wait- ers, and Hollywood's Tarzan,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The admen are dull. The waiters reserve their best service for the best tippers. And Tarzan’s jungle cry is scaring the chickens and pigs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trud, the organ of the Soviet trade unions, set its sights on the ad writers. It accused them, in writing about food, for example of ‘‘a heavy style and complicated language that don’t make sense.” It cited this example:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Tangerine juice is liquid fruit— i.e, the liquid part of the pulp pressed from the tangerine, with all the nutritious parts dissolved in it. 100 grams of tangerine juice gives the body 40 to 60 milligrams of vitamin C, or as they say, one mandose.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mandose, incidentally, is the dose of vitamins one man needs for a day.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That language, Trud commented, would “repulse the most ardent lovers of fruit juice.” Let’s have ads in verse—‘‘clear, brief an bright’’—the paper suggested.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soviet waiters had their inning in Krokodil (Crocodile), the popu- lar satirical weekly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably the Soviet citizen is well enough off so he doesn't ex- pect or solicit tips. But it’s a rare barber, waiter or taxi driver that refuses one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krokodil told the story of a Mos- cow worker and his farmily—man, wife, mother-in-law and two small sons—Wwho visited a restaurant for dinner one Sunday night.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman was surprised to see the children. The waiter want- ed to seat a late-arriving party of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Army officers in their stead but the officers refused. It too a strug- gle to get a waiter to take the or- der. The steak was so tough the mother-in-law couldn't chew it. And the waiter tried to overcharge the family.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Tarzan, as played by Johnny Weissmuller, he’s one of the biggest drawing cards in the Soviet Union. Lately the jungle films, along with cowboy and pi- rate films, have been shown widely in villages from an open truck. Of this Pravda says:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“From the continuous scream- ing and_ shooting, chickens are awakened from their sleep and panic caused among the livestock in the barns and villages at night.”’  |
