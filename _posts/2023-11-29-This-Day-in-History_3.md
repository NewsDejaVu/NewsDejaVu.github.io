| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid a growing advertiser exodus over antisemitism on his social media site, Elon Musk told advertisers he doesn’t want their money — in no uncertain terms. “Go f--- yourself,” Musk said at the New York Times DealBook conference Wednesday, addressing the growing list of advertisers who have stopped spending money on X, formerly Twitter, over concerns that Musk himself was amplifying antisemitism and racism on the social media site. He appeared to specifically call out Disney chief executive Bob Iger, whose company is among those who paused advertising on X, saying, “Hi, Bob.” Iger had spoken earlier at the conference, but it was unclear if he was still in the room when Musk spoke.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What this advertising boycott is going to do is to kill the company,” Musk said before a crowd of business executives and journalists gathered at the Lincoln Center in Manhattan; the conference was also streamed live online.

Walter Thompson, Co. said a poll conducted in March shows that 10 per cent of viewers apparently consider not buying products because they are advertised on programs they consider excessively violent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight per cent reported ‘consciously not buying a product.” he told the annual convention of the American Advertising Federation here Tuesday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that even if subsequent polls show only 4 per cent of viewers reject products because they are advertised in connection with violence, **! cannot imagine any advertiser who would want to risk negative sales of these proportions.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnston said the survey, although preliminary. corroborates other indications “that public hostility to violent TV programming is growing .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said the J. Walter Thompson agency is ‘counselling our clients to evaluate the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; potential negatives of placing com- mercials in programming perceived as violent.’ Opponents of TV violence are organizing, he said, and Johnston predicted their actions will be felt ‘‘more and more ... in letters of protest and in product boycotts.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnston also said he personally opposes excessive violence on TV, and so does the agency,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We are questioning that part of TV programming that exploits violence.”’ he said. ‘'We believe it is socially and psy- chologically damaging to large sections of the population.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnston said the agency's poll was conducted among 200 adult TV viewers. He said the agency has decided to expand the survey ‘‘to verify the preliminary results.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among these results. he said, is that two of every five persons said they avoid watching programs they consider too vio- lent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, one of every five men and one of every three women said they prevent their children from watching programs they thought were excessively violent. he added.  |
