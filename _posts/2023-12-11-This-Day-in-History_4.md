| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I wrote about Gavin Wax, the head of the hard-right New York Young Republican Club (NYYRC), was in the wake of its annual fundraising dinner last December. Wax, who was joined that evening by Donald Trump Jr., Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and other figures from the right-most fringe of national and international politics, described his vision for political activism.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We want total war,” Wax said. “We must be prepared to do battle in every arena. In the media. In the courtroom. At the ballot box. And in the streets.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, this was simply a small component of broad, shallow rhetoric hinting at political violence and a need for an extremist response to the moment. Not unimportant but still distant from actual anti-democratic actions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, at the NYYRC’s 2023 iteration of its dinner, Wax returned to the theme.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Once President Trump is back in office,” he said, according to Politico, “we won’t be playing nice anymore.

It came from outstanding mem- ivers of the Democratic party. It found   virile expression in the editorial col- umns of staunch Democratic news- papers.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   |
