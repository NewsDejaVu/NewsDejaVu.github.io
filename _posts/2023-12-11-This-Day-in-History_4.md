| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I wrote about Gavin Wax, the head of the hard-right New York Young Republican Club (NYYRC), was in the wake of its annual fundraising dinner last December. Wax, who was joined that evening by Donald Trump Jr., Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and other figures from the right-most fringe of national and international politics, described his vision for political activism.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We want total war,” Wax said. “We must be prepared to do battle in every arena. In the media. In the courtroom. At the ballot box. And in the streets.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, this was simply a small component of broad, shallow rhetoric hinting at political violence and a need for an extremist response to the moment. Not unimportant but still distant from actual anti-democratic actions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, at the NYYRC’s 2023 iteration of its dinner, Wax returned to the theme.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Once President Trump is back in office,” he said, according to Politico, “we won’t be playing nice anymore.

President Nixon said to me, ‘How did you feel when you weren't president any more?’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘And I said, ‘J don’t know whether you'll understand this now or not, but you certainly will later. I sat there on that platform and waited for you to stand up and raise your right<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand and take the oath of office, and I think the most pleasant words that I ever— that ever came into my ears were ‘so help me God’’ that you repeated after that oath.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘* ‘Because at that time 1 no longer had the fear that I was the man that could make the mistake of involving the world in war, that I was no longer the man that would have to carry<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the terrifying responsibility of protecting the lives of this country and maybe the entire world, unleasing the horrors of some of our great power if I felt that that was required. ‘But that now I could ride back down that avenue, being concerned about what hap- pened, being alarmed about what might happen, but just really knowing that I wasn’t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going ta be the cause of it--that that went over to some other man, and that’s a feeling that I don't think you'll ever know until you experience it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘**But you will experience it when the man who succeeds you takes that oath, and when you do, most people won't believe you because they'll they'll think you always want power.’ ”  |
