| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Kate Cox, whose fetus had a fatal condition, did not qualify for an abortion in Texas: not after four emergency room visits, elevated vital signs, risks of a uterine rupture and with her ability to have more children in jeopardy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Texas Supreme Court’s rejection of the mother of two’s request for an exception under the state’s restrictive ban has laid bare the high threshold women in many states must meet to get the procedure: pregnancy complications that pose life-threatening danger to the mother.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“These laws reflect the policy choice that the Legislature has made, and the courts must respect that choice,” the court’s nine Republican justices said in their ruling late Monday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state’s Republican attorney general had for a week argued that Cox did not meet the standard for an exception, despite appeals from her attorneys that her health was deteriorating.

I would have liked for the court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, because the car- nage will continue.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling, coupled with the possibility that abortion laws will be tightened further when the Su- preme Court rules next year on three other cases, was cheered by abortion foes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortion rights activists de- nounced the ruling, saying it will galvanize support for their posi- tion and vowing to make the issue a “litmus test” for legislators seeking re-election.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Legislators are going to be in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See ABORTION on Page 9  |
