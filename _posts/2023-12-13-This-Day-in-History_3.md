| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The birth of their daughter should have marked the beginning of a joyful chapter for the young Palestinian couple.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the devastating war in Gaza, now in its third month, has turned childbirth and parenthood into a time of worry and fear for Salim and Israa al-Jamala.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, they endured a perilous journey, dodging missile fire, to reach a maternity ward. And now, the couple is sheltering with their newborn in the partially tented courtyard of another hospital where they can’t care properly for their now 3-week-old daughter, her mother’s namesake.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife’s breast milk is not sufficient because she cannot eat enough as a result of widespread food shortages, said the 29-year-old Salim, rocking baby Israa, swaddled in blankets in a crib cobbled together from wood scraps.

She now occupies 75 per cent of China's commercial and industria! areas,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   And yet, according to the con- Sensus of qualified foreign observ- ers here, she is little nearer to the successful realization of her ob- jectives than she was six months ago.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefields on which  be- tween 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 men have been mobilized by both sides spread out over an area more than half the size of Europe, engulfing civilians in war's destructive tides.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign military attaches and welfare workers estimated that about 450,000 Chinese soldiers have been killed and 850,000 wounded.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chinese civilian casualties were es- timated at 500,000, including 75,090 killed. ,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same sources estimated that Japanese casualties were more than 300,000, of which roughly 90 - 000 were killed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Chinese have been driven far inland and the Japan- ese are in posession of most of the principal ports of China and their vast revenues, there is little pros-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: pect of peace.
