Thalido- mide is blamed for thousands of -armiess and legless babies born lin Europe, Australia and Canada. _ The Arizona court refused the Finkbines’ appeal for a legal abor- tion, because the only ground on which it could be granted would be if the mother's life were im   danger.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sweden permits abortions under ‘certain conditions. The Royal Medical Board has authorized sev- en women who took thalidomide to have abortions.  |
