Doctors have recommended the young mother of four undergo the abortion be- cause of the possibility her child has been deformed by a drug, thalidomide, which she took in the early stages of her pregnancy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drug has been blamed for thousands of malformed babies born in Europe and other coun- tries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finkbine said after a confer- ence with her attorneys and doc- tors they would “seek help in a more favorable legal climate.” He refused to say where that might be.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Finkbine’s chances for an abortion without risk of prosecu- tion might be best in Japan, Den- mark, or the Soviet Union.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other states in the United States have laws similar to Ari- zona.

She is disappointed, but has her chin up.”  |
