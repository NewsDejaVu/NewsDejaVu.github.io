| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) — President Joe Biden used a backdrop of the world’s largest facility for wind tower manufacturing to sharpen his criticism of Republicans Wednesday, saying the company’s expansion validates an environmental agenda his political opponents want to undo.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company that Biden visited, CS Wind, is on the home turf of Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who has described the president’s climate policies as “a massive failure.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Did you all know that you’re part of a massive failure?” Biden said to the workers and local officials gathered for his speech as he touted hundreds of new jobs fueled by tax incentives for clean energy initiatives. “None of that sounds like a massive failure to me. How about you?”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biden’s rebuttal to Boebert was fresh evidence of the Democratic president’s intention to more aggressively push back against what he calls “MAGA Republicans.” He has been struggling with low approval ratings, and Democrats are anxious for him to gain ground politicall ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-boebert-colorado-republicans-0edd0c6f25fe17edd92f8c80b0488f89](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-boebert-colorado-republicans-0edd0c6f25fe17edd92f8c80b0488f89) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DALLAS (AP) — George McGovern is in Texas trying to cement former Gov. John B. Connally into position as a sym- bol of special interests and tax loopholes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McGovern, the Democratic presidential candidate, said late Wednesday that if Connally — a Democrat turned supporter of President Nixon — were boosting McGovern’s White House hopes instead, ‘‘I’d really know I was off the track.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘It hasn’t surprised me at all that John Connally and his bil- lionaire friends have decided they are more at home support- ing Richard Nixon’s brand of Republicanism than they are backing the Democratic national ticket this year,” McGovern told a crowd of about 3,000 in downtown Dallas.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He contrasted Connally to two other well known Texans — the late Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn and former President Lyndon B. Johnson, whom McGovern visited at the LBJ Ranch last month. Those men, McGovern told the enthusiastic and predominantly young crowd, “never ran away from the Democratic ticket in a pres- idential election year.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, his second visit to the populous and therefore politically important state, McGovern planned appearances today at at Dallas supermarket to illustrate what he terms the failure of the President’s antiinflation efforts, and a trip to the Houston Space<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Center. Later today he planned to campaign in Peoria and Rockford, Ill.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other McGovern campaign developments:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—The Democratic hopeful stressed harder than any time since his nomination that his campaign needs money.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We've been trying to be as optimistic as we could,” he said in a television interview in San Diego bebe we before leaving for Texas. ‘‘But   think the time has come for us to let people know that we need money. We need help. It is uphill.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—There were indications that voters are increasingly con- cerned about McGovern’s posi- tion on so-called quotas for em- ployment. Before the Southern California Board of Rabbis in Los Angeles early Wednesday and again in San Diego questioners asked McGovern if he supports quotas for racial, sex or age groups.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McGovern said, “I do not personally believe in percentage quota systems. I would never sign my name on anything saying that 10 per cent of the people in a particular department have to be black or brown or red. I would say that we have to step up our efforts to recruit more people from these minority groups that have been passed by.”’  |
