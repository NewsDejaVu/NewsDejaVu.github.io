| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JENIN REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank (AP) — Israeli forces operating in the occupied West Bank killed at least eight Palestinians, including at least one militant, in a 24-hour period, Palestinian health officials said Sunday, as a fragile pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip entered its third day.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violence in the West Bank has surged in the weeks since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, setting off a devastating war in the Gaza Strip. Israeli forces have killed dozens of Palestinians and arrested hundreds in the West Bank. Jewish West Bank settlers have also stepped up attacks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Palestinian Health Ministry said that five Palestinians were killed in the militant stronghold of Jenin, while three others were killed in separate areas of the West Bank since Saturday morning.

Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek declared that ‘‘coexistence bet- ween Jews and Arabs has collapsed.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Widespread demonstrations rocked the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in one of the worst days of bloodshed since the protests began Dec. 8. Jerusalem also suffered as Arab activists cut a water main, leaving several neighborhoods dry.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other Arabs — a 15-year- old boy hit in the head by a soldier Saturday and a 10-year- old boy struck 4 a bullet last week — died of injuries suffered earlier and dozens more were hospitalized after they were beaten and teargassed by Israeli troops.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disturbances began after Jewish settlers launched an overnight attack on Arab-owned<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cars in Hebron. Other attacks by Jewish vigilante groups were rumored to have occurred around the West Bank.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations said the fatalities brought to 48 the number of Palestinians killed in more than two months of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; demonstrations against the Israeli occupation, which began in 1967. A woman killed Satur- day in the West Bank was not in- cluded after the United Nations said it could not confirm that she was killed by Israeli soldiers.  |
