Three of the guerrillas were killed in a mission to attack Is- raeli targets and three were slain during an attack on militiamen, the army said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arab demonstrators in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River and Gaza Strip hoisted hundreds of outlawed Palestinian flags to mark a PLO-organ- ized “Flag Day.” Arab reports said Israeli soldiers shot and killed a donkey decorated with both Pales- tinian and Israeli flags.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army said an officer and two soldiers were indicted on charges of aggravated assault in connec- tion with the beating of two bound Arabs in the West Bank city of Nablus last month.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beating, which lasted more than 30 minutes, was taped by CBS News and sparked international criticism of the crackdown in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel occupied after the 1967 Mid- dle East war.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday’s fatalities brought to 83 the number of Palestinians killed since violence erupted in the oc- cupied territories on Dec. 8, according to UN fig- ures.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a gun battle Sunday, Israeli-supported militia- men of the South Lebanon Army repulsed an attack by Shiite Moslem guerrillas in southern Lebanon, killing three assailants, according to the army. It did not report any militia casualties.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle occurred near the village of Meiss el Jabal, about a half-mile from the Israeli border, army officials reported.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said guerrilla groups in Lebanon were step- ping up attacks against Israel to back the Arab pro- testers in the occupied territories.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Gaza City, troops stormed Shifa Hospital and arrested three Palestinians after youths inside the compound threw stones, the army said. Hospital offi- cials said one detainee, a 15-year-old boy with a broken right hand, was taken from his bed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loudspeakers in nearby Shati refugee camp called for help, and hundreds began marching to- ward the hospital before they were stopped by sol- diers using tear gas and rubber bullets, witnesses said. The army said it clamped a curfew on Shati.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shifa doctors staged a sit-in strike to protest the arrests inside the hospital.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Troops surrounded Ramallah Hospital in the West Bank for several hours after protesters standing on the roof threw stones and a firebomb at soldiers, the army said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospitals have become centers of tension in the occupied territories in recent weeks.  |
