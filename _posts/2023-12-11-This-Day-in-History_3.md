| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A pregnant Texas woman whose fetus has a fatal condition left the state to get an abortion elsewhere before the state Supreme Court on Monday rejected her unprecedented challenge of one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, had spent nearly a week seeking court permission in Texas to end her pregnancy, but her attorneys said she could not wait any longer and left the state. Her baby has a condition known as trisomy 18, which has low survival rates, and her lawsuit argued that continuing the pregnancy jeopardized both her health and ability to have more children.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Texas’ abortion ban makes narrow exceptions when the life of the mother is in danger but not for fetal anomalies. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that Cox had not shown that any of the complications in her pregnancy rose to the level of threatening her life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Her health is on the line.

Penny Pul- len said she will revise a bill that would make it illegal for doctors to perform outpatient abortions<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on patients more than 20 weeks pregnant if they determine the fetus could live.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is before a legislative committee in Springfield.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“T think we probably can go be- yond (what the bill says now) and would be rewriting this bill to whatever the Supreme Court would allow,” said Pullen, a lead- ing anti-abortion activist. “There is some protection for the unborn in the Missouri law. I would have liked for the court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, because the car- nage will continue.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling, coupled with the possibility that abortion laws will be tightened further when the Su- preme Court rules next year on three other cases, was cheered by abortion foes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortion rights activists de- nounced the ruling, saying it will galvanize support for their posi- tion and vowing to make the issue a “litmus test” for legislators seeking re-election.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Legislators are going to be in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See ABORTION on Page 9  |
