| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Silent Night” is not that silent after all. The 19th-century Austrian Christmas carol has been covered so many times by so many artists that if you take the 2 minutes and 40 seconds of Bing Crosby’s 1942 version as a sort of average duration, you could play “Silent Night” nonstop for a week without repeating a version.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than 3,700 interpretations of “Silent Night,” making it the all-time most covered song, according to the online database SecondHandSongs.com. A distant second is the aria “Summertime” (more than 2,300 covers), and another holiday banger, “White Christmas,” comes in third with over 2,100 covers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opera singers, choirs, crooners, pop divas, jazz ensembles, and even surf and punk bands have reinterpreted “Silent Night.” They’ve sung it in hundreds of languages, including Gaelic, Arabic, Swahili and Japanese.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Silent Night’ covers, by year of release English Instrumental Other language First cover in the database of the original version in German 1900 1910  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2023/12/08/silent-night-covers/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2023/12/08/silent-night-covers/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christmas caroling is almost as old as Christmas itself -- though not inthe form we know it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An early historian wrote that in the Sec- ond Century the bishop of Rome urged his people to sing "in celebration of our Lord." Christmas hymns go back to the Fifth Cen- tury, when most of them were written in Latin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Francis of Assisi is regarded as the father of caroling as we know it, accord- ing to World Book Encyclopedia. In 1223,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A oe Se ER a a igre Nae tins<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people began acting out the Christmas story, The ac- tors composed carols to sing with their Nativity plays and after the plays they would stroll down the street, singing In that way, street caroling was born.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph Mohr, a pastor in Ob. erndorf, Austria, composed "Stille Nacht,” or "Silent Night, " on Christmas Eve, 1818. Franz Gruber, the local schoolmaster and organist, composed the music the same day, and the hymn was sung for the first time at Midnight Mass that night.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles Wesley, brother of John Wesley, wrote, “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing!" in 1739, Phillips Brooks, a noted Boston clergyman, wrote “O Little Town of Bethlehem” in 1868 after visiting Bethlehem. / Though not a carol, Handel’: -noble “Messiah” is a Christ- mas tradition, It first was per formed in Dublin in 1742."Joy to the World, " written in the early 18th Century by Isaac<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watts, was set to the music of a segment of the "Messiah, "<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“While Shepherds watched Their Flocks by Night, " writ- ten in 1703 by Nahum Tate, was set to music taken from<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siroe, " an opera by Handel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows who wrote "The First Noel,” It first ap- peared in print ia 1833 in a book called "Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern, " and is believed to be very old.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author of God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen, " also is unknown, but he lived before Shakespeare.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you should go caroling this Christmas season, think of other carolers of years gone by, of the people of Charles Dickens’ time in their beav- er hats and cutaway coats, of English villagers in hose and jerkin, of good St. Francis, and of the priests of the time of the Christian Roman Em- pire who, before caroling as we know it existed, sang “in celebration of our Lord. “  |
