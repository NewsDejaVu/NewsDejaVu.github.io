Carlos A. Kolungia also had resigned as Navy secretary.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a * %<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Jose Maria Guido nei:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘ther accepted nor rejected the -mass_ resignations menadiately, He told Alsogaray he would start a round of consultations—begin- ning with the military leaders of the government—today.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war secretary, Lt. Gen.   Benjamin Rattenbach, apparently precipitated Alsogaray’s decision to quit by stating at a news con-   ference that the economic minis- ter's policies were not adequate to pull Argentina out of its slump.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alsogaray said the head of the  army told him on Monday ‘‘other Cabinet ministers are feeling the same way."’ Alsogaray’s austerity   policy was always opposed by   large business, labor and armed i forces groups, but he and his team ne have strong connections with ; certain business, political and mil- itary factions,   * e *<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposition mounted last week when Alsogaray in an effort to   balance the budget boosted the price of gasoline 43 per cent and ; that of kerosene, widely used for cooking, by 66 per cent. The in- creases triggered another spiral in ‘essential consumer goods prices.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alsogaray started his present term as economic minister on Ap- ril 12. He had held it for a time under President Arturo Frondizi.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found the economy in chaos. Since then things have worsened The peso kept stable for three pyoere under Frondizi at 83 to the dollar, was quoted by some brok: ers at 154 Tuesday.
