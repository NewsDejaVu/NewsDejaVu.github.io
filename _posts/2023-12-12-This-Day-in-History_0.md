| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina on Tuesday announced a sharp devaluation of its currency and cuts to energy and transportation subsidies as part of shock measures new President Javier Milei says are needed to deal with an economic emergency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economy Minister Luis Caputo said in a televised message the Argentine peso will be devalued by 50% to 800 to the U.S. dollar from 400 pesos to the dollar.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“For a few months, we’re going to be worse than before,” Caputo said, two days after the libertarian Milei was sworn in as president of the second largest economy in South America and immediately warned of tough measures.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milei has said the country didn’t have time to consider other alternatives.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Argentina is suffering 143% annual inflation, its currency has plunged and four in 10 Argentines are impoverished. The nation has also a yawning fiscal deficit, a trade deficit of $43 billion, plus a daunting $45 billion debt to the International Monetary Fund, with $10.6 billion due to the ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/argentina-economy-dollar-devaluation-economy-cuts-28089d64ae72bde12d53be59b5bc5a85](https://apnews.com/article/argentina-economy-dollar-devaluation-economy-cuts-28089d64ae72bde12d53be59b5bc5a85) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Press Foreign News Editer<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Argentina's President Juan Dom- ingo Peron is in trouble.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the cheers of the ‘‘shirtless ones,” who helped place and keep him in power, have: a_ hullow, artificial sound.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and again in the past they have been primed by dramatic gifts, wage boosts and other ben- efits. But today Peron’s regime is plagued by runaway inflation and a first-class economic crisis.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the new wage boost the “shirtless ones'’ want, they aren't ‘likely to get.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rese From<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peron, who rose from suscarity to unrivaled power in Argentina in less than 10 years, today is a strangely lonely man.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife, who shared and some- times appeared to usurp his power, is dead—and with her much of the showmanship which was the found- stion of his popular appeal. Four others of his most intimate col- leagues also have died during the past 12 months, one by auicide.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The almost legendary name he wrote for himself is being openly smeared with charges of graft and corruption. His.entire cabinet is reported on the verge of resigning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis at hand today has been predicted for years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sternest repressive measures —hundreds of arrests, price freez. ing orders, threats against live.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stock growers who withheld their cattle from the markets—have failed to stem ,the upward rusif of living costs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaudy show which dazzled the shirtless ones in Evita Peron’s heyday, suddenly is being turr.ed against Peron.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cenfrented With<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Argentinians, confronted with an   abrupt 50 per cent increase in the   price of fooistuffs in a single fort- night, suddenly have been recalling with bitterness Evita’s glittering jewels, her Christian Dior gowns and her sable and mink.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few days ago, Peron was forced to deny publicly and bitterly that she was ‘‘the richest woman fn the world.’’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others circulated the story that Evita'’s brother, Juan Duarte. until la week ago Peron’s private sec- retary, was the owner of huge   new hotels, owned a fortune of a billion pesos and held a monopoly jon the importation of whisky, tea, automobiles and many luxury goods.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duarte committed suicide last week, leaving a note protesting   the “slanders” of his name.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' Ugly suspicions and whispered charges of graft and corruption girculated on all sides.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are many who read a bit of prophecy in the final sen- tence of Juan Duarte’s suicide note. - “f came with Evita,’ he wrote.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  with her I go.”  |
