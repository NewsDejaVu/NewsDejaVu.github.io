| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump on Saturday night suggested President Joe Biden “should have to take a cognitive test” only to confuse who administered the test to him in the next sentence. The former president and presumptive Republican nominee referred to Texas Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson who was the White House physician for part of his presidency as “Ronny Johnson.” The moment came as Trump was questioning Biden’s mental acuity something he often does on the campaign trail and social media. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/trump-mental-acuity-gaffe-biden-ronny-jackson-0d45b6d89ae295b690f5ad12ca0bd38a)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LONDON — The Washington correspondents of most London newspapers told their readers today that the American people are increasingly dubious of President Eisenhowers physical fitness for re-election. Growing U.S. view he should quit fight headlined the Conservative Daily Mail. There is deep disquiet in the United States today over President Eisenhowers health despite the optimistic and almost ebullient Statements of the doctors the Mail said. It added: The American public would be less perturbed if even one of the 13 or more doctors who attended the President had counseled caution or restraint or even said Let us see how the President gets along—let us not rush things. The pro-Labor party Daily Mirror declared bluntly: Public confidence in the medical opinions have been shaken by Saturdays operation and it will take much more than publicity about Ikes golfing prowess to convince them that he is fit enough for another term. The independent Times said the political implications of his present illness have possibly assumed a greater insistence than the fears inspired by his heart attack last year. The middle-of-the-road News Chronicle said Neither America nor the world would forget it if the politicians were to urge the President to work beyond his physical endurance. The Laborite Daily Herald said millions of American voters may feel a little sickened perhaps if they feel or know that Ike’s expectation of life is being sacrificed on the altar of the Republican party machine. |

| North Dakota Voters Just Approved An Age Limit For Congressional Candidates | Congress Approves Lowering Voting Age To 18 |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BISMARCK N.D. (AP) — People in their late 70s or older can no longer run for Congress in North Dakota under a ballot measure overwhelmingly approved by voters Tuesday and legal scholars said the law could remain on the books indefinitely because no elderly candidate might challenge the restriction they deem likely unconstitutional. Those experts view the constitutional amendment as an effort to revisit a nearly 30-year-old Supreme Court ruling against congressional term limits and could provi ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/north-dakota-congressional-candidates-age-limit-b9ffa598e76bf1dd440b3fb8efd4c33b)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to lower the minimum voting age to 18 years in all elections—federal state and local—won final congressional approval Tuesday and was sent to the states for ratification. The amendment passed the House 400 to 19 easily meeting the requirement for a two-thirds majority on proposals to amend the Constitution. The Senate passed the measure last month 94 to 0 and no presidential action is required. Before it can become the 26th amendment to the Constitution the measure must be ratified by at least 38 state legislatures. Its supporters hope the required three-fourths of the 50 states will ratify the amendment in time for the 1972 elections. There was some opposition in debate to passage of a constitutional amendment that would remove state powers to set minimum voting ages for state and local balloting. The voting age for federal elections — for president the Senate and the House—was set at 18 by Congress last year. Rep. Emanuel Celler D-N.Y. chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said the amendment was sure to pass. Any effort to stop it would be as useless as a telescope to a blind eye. Youth will be served he said. The amendment would not have been needed had the 1970 Voting Rights Act stood up in court. That law set the voting age of 18 for all elections but the Supreme Court said Congress could establish voting ages by statute only for federal elections. That meant that either the state legislatures would have to lower the voting age or the U.S. Constitution would have to be amended. Because only Alaska Georgia and Kentucky have adopted the 18-year-old voting age and a number of states could not make the change without amending their own constitutions Congress decided to do it all with one measure. The amendment was rushed through Congress so states and locals would not have to provide for costly and confusing dual voting systems—one for federal offices and another for state and local offices. Sponsors of the legislation said it would cost New York City alone 35. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOKYO (AP) — Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West has died. He was 95. Maki who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard died June 6 his office Maki & Associates said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age.

The rebellious old gentleman as friends referred to him in his later years succumbed following an emergency operation Monday for treatment of an intestinal tract obstruction. He had responded well to the surgery his doctor said but apparently his age made recovery impossible. Critics often disputed whether Wright was the greatest American architect of the 20th Century but all agreed he certainly was the most famous for his individualistic style—a blending of precision machine-age lines with natures living forms in stone steel wood or glass. Wright maintained a home and school called Taliesin West on the desert near here although he normally spent his summers in Wisconsin where he built a spacious low native-stone rambling house also named Taliesin—Welsh for radiant brow—at Spring Green during his mid-years. He is survived by his widow a noted architect son Frank Lloyd Wright Jr. and a motion picture actress-granddaughter Anne Baxter as well as numerous children grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His doctor said Wright died at 5:45 a.m. est. of complications resulting from the operation. He entered the hospital last Saturday. Both artistically and personally Wrights life was a battle with the contemporary schools of thought. And he captured acclaim abroad long before his own country recognized him as a titanic force in building design through the American |

He said: “In my judgment a minimum speed law is even more justifiable and necessary than a maximum speed law. “There are too many hamlets in the United States that effect a bustling metropolitanism by sticking up a traffic light without which the motorist would hardly know a town existed” |
