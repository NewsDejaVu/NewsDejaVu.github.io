| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MANAMA Bahrain (AP) — The U.S. and a host of other nations are creating a new force to protect ships transiting the Red Sea that have come under attack by drones and ballistic missiles fired from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced Tuesday in Bahrain. The seriousness of the attacks several of which have damaged vessels has led multiple shipping companies to order their ships to hold in place and not enter the Bab el-Mandeb Strait until the security situ ...<br><br>Read the full article [here](https://apnews.com/article/attacks-red-sea-navy-mission-missiles-286d51bfd65e741e839e185f0f4a455b). | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pentagon on Tuesday ordered an eight-ship battle group led by the aircraft carrier Ranger to take up stations off the Pacific Coast of Central America “to underscore U.S. support for friendly nations in the region.” The announcement came as President Reagan charged that the Soviet Union and Cuba are building “a war machine in Nicaragua by their own boasts to impose a revolution without frontiers.” Reagan made no mention of the naval movements which coincide with preparations for U.S. military exercises in Honduras probably early next month involving an estimated 4000 to 5000 troops. But the president did say that “for the first time in memory we face real dangers on our own borders” and “We must not permit dictators to ram communism down the throats of one Central America country after another.” Earlier U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick said the people of Nicaragua can overturn the Sandinista government if they summon “the will and determination.” But the House in its third secret session in 153 years considered a cutoff of covert U.S. aid to counterrevolutionaries. And Reagan named 11 people including a former Supreme Court Justice the head of the AFL-CIO and a former governor of Texas to serve with former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger on a national commission to develop long-term policy for Central America. Kissinger as Reagan announced Monday will head the Central America panel. The others include William P. Clements former governor of Texas Lane Kirkland president of the AFL-CIO former Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart and Robert S. Strauss who directed Jimmy Carters re-election campaign in 1980 Other panel appointees: former Sen. Nicholas Brady R-N.J.; Mayor Henry G. Cisneros of San Antonio Texas; Yale University economics professor Carlos F. Diaz-Alejandro; Wilson S. Johnson president of the National Federation of Independent Business; Richard M. Scammon a political consultant; John Silber president of Boston University and William B. Walsh president of Project Hope. The House is expected to vote next week on the proposal to end the not-so-secret U.S. assistance to Nicaraguan counterrevolutionaries. Neither side is confident of victory. Rep. C.W. Young R-Fla. a member of the House Intelligence Committee and a supporter of the administration’s policy of covert aid to the rebels said he found “many in the chamber who are looking for an honorable compromise.” The hourslong secret session “was very factual and almost like a court of law” Young told reporters while taking a break. “The hot debate is apparently being reserved for the open session that will follow.” The administration claims its program of more than $19 million in covert aid to “contras” rebels is aimed solely at stemming a flow of arms from Nicaragua to EI Salvador. But four Democratic congressmen just returned from the area say they are convinced the overriding mission is “clearly to overthrow the Nicaraguan government.” Their comments echoed charges by former President Jimmy Carter who said in Tokyo that “despite semantic denials” his successor has given “enormous amounts of money” to rebels seeking to topple the Sandinistas who celebrated the fourth anniversary of their government on Tuesday. Carter also assailed Reagan for supporting an El Salvador government he said is “one of the most bloodthirsty regimes in the hemisphere if not in the world.” He said a Reagan policy of intervention in Central America had driven leftist elements to seek Cuban and Soviet support. At that it was Carters administration which sent the first American advisers in uniform to El Salvador. And just days before he left office in January of 1981 it approved $5 million in military supplies for the Salvadoran government. Meanwhile Tuesday two civil liberties |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Georgia’s government will put a little extra jingle in the pockets of state university and public school employees paying them a $1000 year-end bonus Gov. Brian Kemp announced Monday. The Republican governor also said he would propose a permanent $104 million yearly allocation for school security going forward enough to provide $45000 to every Georgia public school as he makes further plans to spend Georgia’s $11 billion in surplus funds.

Calvert tuled last night when he received the $47700000 salary hike finally approved by the Senate. Calvert promised to bounce back the check drawn on insufficient state funds today. “I don’t see any point in hgld- ing on to it he said. “It\s up to them {the legislators) to do something about it.” Calvert would not say how much the approved appropriations were over the expected income. Rep. Max Smith vice chairman of the joint appropriations com- mittee estimated the shortage at about seven million dollars. However he said he talked with Gov. Price Daniel early last night and the governor estimated the dis- crepancy at nine million dollars. The governor\s office had no im- mediate comment. “A bunch of boys from both the House and Senate planned to meel this morning and see what we can do Smith said Calvert said he met last night with a group of Senate finance leaders discussing {he situation. The new crisis. along with some old crises that refused to be salvec yesterday put a crimp into plans for final adjournment at 6 p.m tomorrow. Overnight the adjourn ment odds shifled to Friday. Sat urday and maybe next week. The development also revivec considerable talk about the likeli hood of Daniel calling a special session probably in early fall i the teachers’ pay raise and Insur. atice Commission reorganizatior problems aren\t solved to his sat isfaction. On Monday Daniel told a press conference he “wouldn\t even think about a special session until we see whet unfinished business the Legislature Jeaves.” |

| Largest Nursing Home In St. Louis Closes Suddenly Forcing Out 170 Residents | Chicago Rest Home Chain Broken Up By Authorities |

| 2023-12-18 | August 18, 1962 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest skilled nursing facility in St. Louis has closed suddenly forcing about 170 residents to be bused to other care centers. Many left with nothing but the clothes they were wearing. The abrupt shutdown of Northview Village Nursing Home on Friday came after workers learned they might not be paid and walked out confusing residents and their relatives. Many family members gathered through the day Saturday outside the facility on the city’s north side. Some didn’t immedi ...<br><br>Read the full article [here](https://apnews.com/article/northview-nursing-home-closure-st-louis-78f24bc169ca7aaeed7aeb776e23dd80). | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public spotlight touched briefly on one of fast-paced society’s saddest backwaters this week when Cook County authorities clamped down on a Chicago nursing home chain. In the 17 homes operated by Dr. Leonard Tilkin a psychiatrist were 558 county relief patients. Those in 14 of them were bundled out—into other nursing homes. Three of the Tilkin homes continued operating but under new management. Tilkin’s troubles with finances and nursing staff resulted in accusations by officials of failure to provide adequate care. Most patients were old persons with assistance allotments averaging under $200 a month per patient. This is considerably below the level charged for care by most private nursing homes. Nursing homes are seldom measured in official ratings in terms meaningful to the infirm man or woman of 80-plus years who must leave home and family unwillingly for what is often a prison hospital regimen. As the 70s turn into 80s and complications of health deterioration mount there are few withered humans who remain lovable. Senility takes hold. The facial expressions become crabbed or blank. At this point the country-club type of nursing home gently eases its client out. Relatives are told that a greater degree of nursing care and medical supervision are indicated. The mine-run place takes over. Many nursing homes do not have staffs competent to follow courses of care and treatment prescribed by physicians. Some attempt it haphazardly. State hospitals eventually get many of the unwanted senile dementia victims. But there are private hospitals which specialize in this type of patient. Many do an excellent job. Yet even in these places it is depressing to see a deteriorating individual lashed in with an elastic band cathetered against incontinence gumming semi-soft food at mealtimes because denture care is virtually impossible for them. The restraint is necessary because even with unreliable swollen or arthritic joints the patient tends to wander confusedly and the risk of a fall and a quickly fatal fractured hip is great. The ills of age are inevitable. But they can be eased somewhat or aggravated extremely. How can the family be sure that grandma is as happy as she seemed when her face lit up for her daughters monthly visit? A physician’s answer: “You can’t know what befalls an old person in somebody else’s establishment. The patient can’t report usually. The administrator always reassures the family. “One rule might be—forget the chrome and pink plumbing. Size up the people who run the place—from the top down—and judge on that basis”’ |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OpenAI the artificial intelligence company behind ChatGPT laid out its plans for staying ahead of what it thinks could be serious dangers of the tech it develops such as allowing bad actors to learn how to build chemical and biological weapons. OpenAI’s “Preparedness” team led by MIT AI professor Aleksander Madry will hire AI researchers computer scientists national security experts and policy professionals. ...<br><br>Read the full article [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/18/open-ai-preparedness-bioweapons-madry/). | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW BRUNSWICK N. J. March 28—(4)—A new mechanical brain— resembling a pinball machine on a jackpot rampage—may make _ people obsolete The device described as capable of operating a complete factory without human aid is designated officially as the magnetic drum digital differential analyzer. Its inventor 3l-year-old physicist Floyd Steele calls it Maddida for short. And what Maddida can do was shown .today at the opening of a three-day conference on computing jachinery at the Rutgers university coliege of engineering. Maddida is primarily a computing device with an accuracy of one part in a million and able to handle 4509 additions of eight-place decimal num- bers per second “But it’s even a better control. de- vice’ Steele said. “It will take infor- mation from another machine inter- pret that information and then run that machine.” Automatic Factory Steele who is also an aeronautical engineer at Manhattan Beach Cal. seid the machine was the forerunner of the completely automatic factory— where goods will be produced without help from the human hand or human brain. Until last week Maddida was an air force secret It had been built for the air force by Northrop Aircraft Inc. of Hawthorne Calif. and Steele said it would do the work of a full aircraft crew. But the real significance of the machine Steele says is its small size and low cost. It’s about the size of a pinball machine and the first model costs $25000 but Steele estimates that mass production can cut the cost to $600. Previous digital computers Steele said have ranged in the half-million dollar class and have occupied an area equal to a small-sized ballroom. But even marvelous Maddida can have its troubles Also at the Rutgers exhibition js another device whose computer function is to compute the cause of breakdowns suffered by com- puting machines. |
