It imposed a cease-fire effective the folowing § day, provided for withdrawal of all American military forces, and created the machinery for internationally supervised elec- tions in South Vietnam to provide a final political settle- ment of the issues between the North and the South.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States ended its direct military involvement in Vietnam Thursday when the last of its combat troops here<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were withdrawn and the re- maining American prisoners of war in North Vietnam were released.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coincidentally, the first day following the completion of the U.S. military withdrawal also was the first anniversary of the opening of the North Viet- namese spring offensive of 1972, the last major Communist campaign of the war.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A government command spo- kesman, Lt. Col.Le Trung Hien,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said the 600-man Tong Le Chan base was shelled heavily both Thursday and _ Friday’ by Communist forces that sur- rounded it a month ago. A total<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of 1,427 mortar rounds, rockets and artillery shells hit the base during the two days, he said, killing one man and wounding 25 others.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack on the Tong Le Chan base is the most serious of what the South Vietnamese command said are almost 150 daily Communist violations of the cease-fire.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michel Gauvin, chief of the Canadian delegation to the International Commission for Control and Supervision (ICCS), complained in a statement to the other three members of the commission Friday that the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viet Cong has blocked attempt-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ed investigation of alleged Communist cease-fire  viola- tions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gauvin referred specifically in his statement to a clash reported from the extreme northern section of South Vietnam in which a South Vietnamese unit was wiped out in a clash with Communist troops.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said also that there has been no investigation of earlier charges by the United States and South Vietnam that the Viet Cong has erected missile launching pads around Khe Sanh, a provincial capital 380 miles north of Saigon in an area controlled by Communists.  |
