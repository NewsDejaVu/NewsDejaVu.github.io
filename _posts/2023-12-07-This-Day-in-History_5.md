Burns told The Post: “We could see [the Russians] building really quite formidable fixed defenses, hard to penetrate, really costly, really bloody for the Ukrainians.” But despite these obstacles, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said: “My take is that they didn’t have a choice.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zaluzhny gave the Economist a shopping list of what he thinks he needs to win. First, more drones, so that Ukraine can “conduct massive strikes using decoy and attack drones to overload Russia’s air-defense systems.” To counter Russian drone attacks, he wants hunter drones with nets and other more advanced systems.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ukrainian commander stressed that Ukraine also needs better electronic warfare tools to jam Russian communication and navigation. “EW is the key to victory in the drone war,” he said.

Even in the air, though they are not likely to challenge our superior power for long. they have concentrated addi- tional planes in an effort to harass our beachhead. Their long-range artillery fire from inland hills ex- tends as far as Anzio harbor.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past week, Patterson said, the Germans had the advan-. tage of bad weather which inter-. fered with Allied shipping and: ‘limited the Allied operations in the air.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the landing in Italy at Sa- lerno last September, Patterson said, the casualties to the American   element of the Fifth Army have] been 3,707 killed, 16,510 wounded } and 5,448 missing—a total of 26,665.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the war in the Pacific, Patterson estimated that “perhaps 60 per cent of the Japanese who were  ! killed on the chief Kwajalein is-   lets died during air and naval bom- bardment before the landings.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Army's Seventh division, he said, had 157 killed, 712 wounded and 17 missing in taking Kwajalein island. The original Japanese force   in the area occupied by the Seventh division, he stated, “amounted to   almost 5,000 men, most of whom } were killed.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   |
