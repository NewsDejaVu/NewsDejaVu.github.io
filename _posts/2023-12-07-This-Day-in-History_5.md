| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIA reckoned Ukraine had a 50-50 chance of success, and an intelligence assessment predicted the Ukrainians would fall “well short” of their goals, The Post wrote.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIA Director William J. Burns told The Post: “We could see [the Russians] building really quite formidable fixed defenses, hard to penetrate, really costly, really bloody for the Ukrainians.” But despite these obstacles, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said: “My take is that they didn’t have a choice.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zaluzhny gave the Economist a shopping list of what he thinks he needs to win. First, more drones, so that Ukraine can “conduct massive strikes using decoy and attack drones to overload Russia’s air-defense systems.” To counter Russian drone attacks, he wants hunter drones with nets and other more advanced systems.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ukrainian commander stressed that Ukraine also needs better electronic warfare tools to jam Russian communication and navigation. “EW is the key to victory in the drone war,” he said. He wants new counter-arti ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/12/07/ukraine-counteroffensive-russia-war-drones-stalemate/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/12/07/ukraine-counteroffensive-russia-war-drones-stalemate/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of The United Press War Desk<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informed military men doubt the soundness of the theory that the American offensive in the Southwest Pacific is intended to divert Japan from an attack on Siberia. They still expect the Siberian attack, and soon. The weather in ‘that region is as suitable now for military operations as it will be this year, and the prevailing con- ditions will not continue much be- yond September. Japanese. intentions can only “iesser and “they” may” have other plans-India, for instance. But operations against India will not be feasible until the end of bbe monsoon in September. The<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japanese have lost the initiativ: in the South Pacific and it is pos aitte that they may not be abl: to regain it, Oniess our opera tions in the Solomon Islands end disastrously.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an outcome seems im- probable, in view of the long and careful preparations<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which must have preceded the attack. The Japanese, therefore, unless they are to remain static for the remaind- er of the summer, must look elsewhere.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two developments support the theory that Eastern Siberia will be the next battleground. One is the German smash in the Cauca- sus and Don-Volga area, which has fared so well that there seems little chance of an upset this year. That means Russia will be unable to divert any strength to the Far Fast to resist a Japanese attack.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is Japan's concentra- tion of land and air strength in Manchukuo, along the Siberian border, The Japanese are under- stood to have the bulk of their strength massed there. The latest information is that there are 25 t> 27 divisions in Manchukue,..twe er three of which were moved in during the past few weeks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japanese divisions vary in size, some being 15,000 men and others 20.000. Counting auxiliary and specialized units, they probably have no fewer than 500,000 men and perhaps as many as 750,000.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, their air strength in Manuchukuo is estimated at 1,- 500 planes, bombers and fighters. Unless the United Nations offen- sive in the south forces them to divert a large part of this force, it is not likely otherwise to affect any plans the Japanese may have with respect to Siberia.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action in the Solomon-— (Continued on Page 2)  |
