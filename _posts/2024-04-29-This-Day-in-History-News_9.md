| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weve all heard of catfish scams – when someone pretends to be a lover on the other side of the screen but instead they arent who they say they are once their real face is revealed. Now theres a similar scam on the rise and its much more sophisticated because scammers can fake the face too. The scam is known as the Yahoo Boys scam and its taking catfishing to a whole new level. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/how-yahoo-boys-use-real-time-face-swapping-to-carry-out-elaborate-romance-scams)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (AP) — One was a young girl one a traveling salesman another a middle-aged widow. Lonely seeking companionship with the opposite sex they paid hundreds of dollars to computer dating firms. And what did they get for their money? We thought because shes handicapped it would be a good way to meet people but she has not had one date said Mrs. Doree Milles of Carteret N.J. whose daughter walks with two canes and paid $395 for dates that never materialized. I could have done better by taking names out of a phone book said the salesman Stanley Pekarsky of Brooklyn. He paid $500 received five names found all five women unsuitable. He was old enough to be my grandfather said the middle-aged widow Harriet Weiner of Flushing Queens of the first date she got for her $395. She tried again and came up with a man of an unsuitable religion. Their stories and others like them came at a public hearing Friday by the state attorney generals office into dating firms to determine if the booming industry of computerized matchmaking needs state regulating. Sometimes it seems that the matches are made only on the basis of ‘You’re a guy and I’m a girl said Asst. Atty. Gen. Stephen Mindell whose office has been flooded with complaints that the dating firms failed to match couples even in such basic areas as age religion and height. Dr. J.R. Block chairman of psychology at Hofstra University said firms that claim to match couples on the basis of 30 separate questions would need a file of at least one billion persons to accomplish this. However he said he believed there was a place for properly-regulated dating firms. There seems to be a need for people to extend the number of people they know he testified.

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUCHAREST Romania (AP) — A court in Romania’s capital on Friday ruled that a trial can start in the case of influencer Andrew Tate who is charged with human trafficking rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women. The Bucharest Tribunal ruled that prosecutors’ case file against Tate met the legal criteria but did not set a date for the trial to begin. Tate’s spokesperson Mateea Petrescu said the ruling has been appealed. Tate 37 was arrested in December 2022 near Bucharest. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/andrew-tate-romania-trial-human-trafficking-rape-4dde5de557094c6eadde73722833327a)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOS ANGELES (AP) - Symbionese Liberation Army member Emily Harris has introduced feminism and politics into an 11 felony-count case against her which the prosecution says is purely a criminal proceeding. Mrs. Harris who is charged along with her husband William and newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst also said she intends to take an active role in her defense against the charges that stem from a 1974 crime spree in the Los Angeles area. The accused terrorist referred to her defense tactics in court when arraignment for her and her husband was postponed one week to give Mrs. Harris a chance to complete her defense team. The Harrises and Miss Hearst are charged with kidnapping with robbery which carries a possible life sentence simple kidnapping six counts of assault with a deadly weapon and three of armed robbery. In a statement Mrs. Harris said she wanted a woman attorney as well as attorney Leonard Weinglass who has represented her so far. She said the combination of Leonard and a woman attorney of her choice would create a defense team that will deal aggressively with the political aspects of the case and will work together as a group of equals. She added that Weinglass who was a defense attorney in the Pentagon papers trial agreed. A spokesman for the district attorney’s office said he viewed the case as purely criminal in nature. It was also learned that Deputy District Attorney Samuel Mayerson was seeking a court order to transfer Miss Hearst from federal custody in the San Mateo County Jail at Redwood City to Los Angeles so the three defendants can be tried at the same time. A spokesman said it would be expensive and difficult to get witnesses to appear at separate trials for Miss Hearst and the Harrises. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAPE CANAVERAL Fla. (AP) — The two NASA astronauts assigned to Boeing’s first human spaceflight arrived at their launch site Thursday just over a week before their scheduled liftoff. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will serve as test pilots for Boeing’s Starliner capsule which is making its debut with crew after years of delay. They flew from Houston into Kennedy Space Center on Thursday. Due to blast off May 6 atop an Atlas rocket the Starliner will fly to the International Space Station ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-space-capsule-starliner-astronauts-nasa-4742d2759c51d63c0d2ec9cbf93fce25)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven eager candidates to be the first American to orbit the earth were named on Thursday. Each confidently proclaimed that he was sure of returning safely if fate hands him the honor. The seven all proud fathers and military pilots also told a jam-packed news conference their wives and families were 100 per cent behind their participation in the governments effort to hurl a manned satellite into space sometime in 1961. The only known exception was one pilots 18-month-old son who doesnt know space from his playpen. The fliers screened from an original field of 55 volunteers were introduced to the public by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Not until actual launching day will they know which of them will be chosen for the assignment. Air Force Capt. Donald K. Slayton 35 from Sparta Wis. seemed to pretty well sum up their attitude. “Id give my left arm to be the first man in space’ he said. As for their wives’ reactions Air Force Capt. Virgil I. Grissom 33 Mitchell Ind. put it most succinctly: “If my wife wasnt as enthusiastic as I I wouldnt be here.” While only one man will be aboard the first manned U.S. satellite to circle the earth the other six candidates are expected eventually to make similar solo flights in an insulated capsule hurled aloft by an Atlas rocket. The first space pilot will be flung into orbit lying on his back on a couch in an insulated capsule. Once in orbit his couch will be upended to provide a normal sitting position. After two or three swings around earth his capsule will come in over the Pacific toward California. The space pilot will fire reverse rockets to slow his speed and reenter the atmosphere over Cape Canaveral Fla his takeoff point. A small parachute will pop out at about 60000 feet to slow the capsule’s speed further. At 10000 feet another bigger parachute will blossom. It will let him down into the ocean where four ships will be waiting to fish him out. |

It’s not just another security camera watching over your house. This thing packs a punch with paintball and tear gas projectiles to really give intruders a surprise they won’t soon forget. How does the high-tech device work? ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/ai-powered-home-security-system-strikes-back-with-paintballs-tear-gas)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAMPA Fla. (AP) — David and Jerri Conarroe a handicapped couple arent afraid of prowlers anymore. They have a friend in Bobby their new 80-pound German shepherd. The Conarroes had spent two months living in fear of intruders. Their apartment was broken into three times and each had been attacked once. Although theyve had him less than a week Bobby already has sent an intruder crashing through the back door leaving a tattered shirt behind. ‘‘Now we can sleep without worrying. We dont have to be scared’’ Conarroe said of their new protector. Conarroe 27 is crippled with a spinal disorder and his 25-year-old wife has a speech impediment. “It’s hell. Its so frightening to be defenseless because youre handicapped’’ Conarroe said. ‘‘Its hard to lie on the floor unable to move because someone so much bigger throws you down and then grabs your wife.” Conarroe suffers from spina bifida a deformity in which structures of the lower spine do not unite properly. Because of the disease Conarroe says he is defenseless against an attacker. ‘What this essentially means is if I had to defend me or my wife someone could punch me in the ribs and Id melt into a pile of oatmeal” he said. “My wife has a speech impediment and when she gets nervous or scared she cant hardly speak. When the guy came in our house the first time she couldnt even speak. Their worries eased this week though when Conarroe’s father bought them Bobby — a usually friendly German shepherd who is short-tempered when it comes to intruders. Monday night the couple went out for a walk with Bobby. When they returned home they let the dog go into the apartment first. ‘Just as I turned on the light I saw this guy standing by the table” Conarroe said. ‘‘Then I saw Bobby lunge over the table after him. |

| Why Arent The Maga Faithful Protesting Trumps Trial/Pity Party? | Voter Forgiveness Asked |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told over and over again that former President Donald Trump’s MAGA faithful are legion that they will follow him to the ends of the earth and that his support is massive and unparalleled. But for some reason the area outside and around Trump’s ongoing criminal trial/pity party in Manhattan has been largely MAGA-free. It seems almost rude to a man who boasts of being beloved. Perhaps the invitations got lost in the mail? While Trump sits in a Manhattan criminal courtroom day after day ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/04/23/trump-trial-protests-maga-rally-supporters/73428067007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUSTIN Tex. — Besieged by his accusers Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Yarbrough admits he has sinned against God and the voters but God has forgiven him in a glorious way. He says he hopes the voters will too. Yarbrough thought to be the first Texas justice to be indicted for a crime made no mention of quitting the job he has held for only six months. In an emotional statement that had him on the verge of tears Yarbrough 36 told a hurriedly called news conference Tuesday: I call you here today in order that I might publicly and without reservation confess to each of you my wrongdoing. Yarbrough was indicted last Thursday after allegedly forging an Alabama auto registration and license tag receipt and lying to the Travis County Grand Jury. The indictment came one day after Harris County District Attorney Carol Vance said he had tapes of conversations linking Yarbrough to a plot to kill former business associate Doug Ford and Victoria banker Bill Kemp a witness against Yarbrough in another proceeding. A State Bar of Texas disbarment trial alleging that Yarbrough has violated the law and the bars code of ethics is set for Aug. 1 and more than a dozen civil suits have been filed against him. The Texas Judicial Qualifications Commission also is considering whether it should try to remove Yarbrough from the nine-member court. In addition Speaker Bill Clayton announced Tuesday the House will consider Yarbroughs removal at a hearing July 15 — four days after the legislature convenes in special session. Without reviewing the substance of my concerns—now so well-known to each of you Yarbrough told reporters I want to say that I never intended that anyone be harmed. It’s not in me. I did make a mistake he said. I did sin against my God and against the people who elected me as their servant. I offer no justification nor excuse for indeed there can be none. I have asked my God through the power of Jesus Christ to forgive me and I know in a very glorious way that He has forgiven me. I do apologize and ask forgiveness from those people in our state who supported me and from those who did not. I have Gods peace and assurance that Hes in control of the situation for the first time in many months and that is a most wonderful and comforting experience. At Yarbrough’s request several police officers guarded doors and kept reporters from getting within 10 feet of the frowning justice. Members of his family including three young children sat on the front row. After reading his brief statement Yarbrough with an enigmatic grin walked from the supreme court chamber ignoring at least one reporters request to answer questions. |

Dr. G. N. Welch city health officer said Illinois health office labeled the outbreak an epidemic on the basis of one poliomyelitis case for each 1000 population. All but two of 21 cases appeared last week. Nearly 200 volunteer men and women sped the opening of an emergency polio center which the state ordered this weekend. The treatment center is a remodeled mansion which the Sister Elizabeth Kenny Foundation abandoned last March saying it was too costly to operate. The Kenny clinic opened after a 1946 epidemic here. The Centralia area cases have been going to St Marys hospital in East St. Louis about 60 miles distant and one to a St. Louis Mo. hospital. The emergency polio center will not turn away any acute cases Dr. Welch said. It will open by Wednesday or if possible Tuesday. The city health officer said about 50 beds were being trucked here today from Chicago. He added that more beds and more medical help will be sent here as needed. Dr Welch said federal help may be asked to try to determine the cause of the outbreak. Cases have not been confined to any one section of the community. Nearly 200 men and women showed up for volunteer duty at the center yesterday after Mayor H. B. Blanchard’s appeal in the citys three theaters Saturday night. Men came with power mowers tractors trucks and rakes to clean up the centers four-acre premises. Women swapped Sunday dress for workday clothing to tidy up the interior. |

R. Haldeman smiled a lot despite hecklers but said very little during his brief visit Thursday in connection with a $1.3 million civil suit filed by protestors barred from a speech by former President Richard M. Nixon. On advice of counsel Ive been told not to make any comment said Haldeman just before he spent about two hours giving a deposition to George S. Daly Jr. attorney for 21 plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Haldeman Nixons ex-chief of staff was added along with two other Nixon aides as defendants in the suit after the Senate Watergate committees investigation revealed Haldeman apparently approved security measures for Nixon’s 1971 visit to Charlotte. The plaintiffs contend they illegally were barred from the Charlotte Coliseum where Nixon spoke at a Billy Graham Day observance. Some of the plaintiffs members of a self-styled revolutionary group known as Red Hornets taunted Haldeman as he walked from his attorney’s car to Dalys office. Bob I want you to tell the truth in there today and don’t lie shouted one of the protestors. I’ve never lied in my life retorted Haldeman one of six Nixon associates scheduled to go on trial in Washington Sept 30 on charges of conspiracy in the Watergate cover-up. The Red Hornets formed to protest the Vietnam war demonstrated outside the Charlotte Coliseum during the Nixon visit and many were prevented from joining the 12000 persons mostly Nixon supporters inside. U. S. District Court Judge James B. McMillan ruled last month that Haldeman White House aide William Henkel Jr. and former White House aide Ronald Walker would be required to come to Charlotte to give depositions in the case. McMillan also ruled that the depositions could be kept secret at least for the time being so as not to prejudice the Watergate trials. No trial date in the suit has been set. |

His remarks were in a speech prepared for the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. The University of Illinois professor cited auto names such as Wildcat Cougar Mustang and Barracuda to back up his point. He quoted advertising copy describing cars that said: ‘All muscle and an almost neurotic urge to get going. A deep breathing growling under the hood. Comes on like Genghis Khan.” One safe-driving pamphlet quoted by OConnell said “We can identify an immature driver “without even looking—just by hearing the way he drives. A reckless or discourteous driver can be a quiet one but usually isnt. He tends to make harsh distinctive noises that reveal his dangerous presence as the rattles growls hisses and buzzes of other menaces.” But OConnell said the same auto company advertised a new model to teenagers with the copy: ‘For stab and steer men there is a new three-speed automatic you can lock in any gear. Make small noises in your throat. Atta boy tiger This model is “just a friendly little sabre-toothed pussy cat. One of these at fast idle sounds like feeding time at the zoo.” OConnell the author of several books on legal aspects of auto safety and accidents told the psychiatrists that psychiatrists should be especially interested in this auto ad: ‘Drive it like you hate it; it’s cheaper than psychiatry.’ He suggested that officials of the psychiatric association focus on the problem and offer their research results to the auto industry. “Ads designed to excite the most dangerous tendencies in drivers are particularly rampant in teen-age car magazines’ OConnell said. |

(AP) — “Itll take us a while to rebuild and the memories will always remain but well bounce back” says Homer Howell a survivor of the tornado which spewed death and destruction in Mississippi. Howell’s words were echoed by others today as the massive mop-up along with damage assessments continued from the killer tornado which struck Jackson and rural counties to the east at dusk two days ago. There were 61 known dead in Mississippi and 497 injured — 19 critically. One man was killed and 11 others injured from the storms final gasp near Tuscaloosa Ala. All sections of the two states that experienced tornado damage were designated as disaster areas Friday by the Small Business Administration making possible loans for rebuilding at low interest rates. “There are just not enough words to describe the horror and devastation the tornado caused said acting Gov Carroll Gartin who estimated damage in Mississippi would exceed $12 million. “It was one of the most horrible scenes Ive ever seen” said Gartin the state’s lieutenant governor who acted for Gov. Paul B. Johnson — in Florida on an industry-hunting junket. Gartin said Game and Fish Commission agents had been ordered to make a house-to-house tour in rural sections to check on people and conditions. Some officials believed more victims might still be found. Outside the Jackson metropolitan area the hardest hit section appeared to be around Leesburg in rural Scott County. Several hundred dairy cows killed in the area were hauled away by trucks. In the Greater Jackson area a suburban shopping center was smashed leaving 12 dead. Industrial plants along the Pearl River were heavily damaged. “But well return to normal” said Howell a resident of Leake County to the east of the capital |
