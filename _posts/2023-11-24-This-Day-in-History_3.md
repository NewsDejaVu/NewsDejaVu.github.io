| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) — who launched a long-shot presidential primary bid against President Biden last month — announced Friday he wouldn’t run for reelection to the House in 2024. “It’s time to pass the torch, it’s time for change, and our best days are yet to come!” Phillips wrote in an X post on Friday that linked to a Star Tribune story where he first announced his decision. Phillips told the Minnesota news organization it would be “irresponsible to continue to string both my constituents along and the other candidates who both have entered the race and who might be interested in entering the race.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2018, Phillips flipped Minnesota’s 3rd Congressional District, which encompasses many of the suburbs in the western half of the Twin Cities metro area. Phillips was the first Democrat to win there since 1958 and he went on to win reelection twice.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congressional candidates in Minnesota have until June 4 to file paperwork to appear on the ballot, according to the Minnesota Sec ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/24/phillips-house-reelection-2024/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/24/phillips-house-reelection-2024/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hubert H. Humphrey and Edward M. Kennedy will battle half-a-continent apart this fall for seats in the U.S. Senate that could put both in a race for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humphrey, announcing his candidacy today in Minnesota, hopes to make his political comeback by winning the seat now held by Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy, D-Minn., who is not seeking re-election.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kennedy was unanimously endorsed by the Massachusetts State Democratic Convention Friday and he told fellow Democrats he would serve a full six-year term if elected. He was thus saying he would not reach for the White House in 1972.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But both Kennedy and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Humphrey would come under increasing pressure from others to seek their party’s nomination in 1972 if they are victorious in November. Democratic Chairman Lawrence F. O’Brien already has touted Kennedy as a possible candidate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an unrelated Senate con- test, incumbent Thomas J. Dodd, D-Conn., issued a brief statement Friday saying he would neither seek nor accept his state’s Democratic Senate nomination.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 63-year-old senator has been plagued in recent months by heart trouble and con- siderable Democratic party opposition for the nomination.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is speculation Dodd will seek re-election to a third term as an independent or third party candidate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humphrey made his an- nouncement at Waverly, Minn.,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where he has been in political exile imposed by voters who elected Richard M. Nixon over the former vice president in 1968.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His opponent in November will be Rep. Clark MacGregor, who is expected to make Humphrey’s_ possible presidential ambitions a campaign issue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Amherst, Mass., Kennedy reiterated his promise not to seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972. He first made the declaration during a speech broadcast nationwide following’ the drowning of Mary Jo Kopechne.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kennedy’s nomination by acclamation was technically only a party endorsement. The primary will be held Sept. 15, but no serious contenders were expected to challenge the 38- year-old Kennedy.  |
