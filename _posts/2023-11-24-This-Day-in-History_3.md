| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) — who launched a long-shot presidential primary bid against President Biden last month — announced Friday he wouldn’t run for reelection to the House in 2024. “It’s time to pass the torch, it’s time for change, and our best days are yet to come!” Phillips wrote in an X post on Friday that linked to a Star Tribune story where he first announced his decision. Phillips told the Minnesota news organization it would be “irresponsible to continue to string both my constituents along and the other candidates who both have entered the race and who might be interested in entering the race.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2018, Phillips flipped Minnesota’s 3rd Congressional District, which encompasses many of the suburbs in the western half of the Twin Cities metro area. Phillips was the first Democrat to win there since 1958 and he went on to win reelection twice.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congressional candidates in Minnesota have until June 4 to file paperwork to appear on the ballot, according to the Minnesota Sec ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/24/phillips-house-reelection-2024/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/24/phillips-house-reelection-2024/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Calling it “the most crucial decision of my life,”’ Utah Rep. Allan T. Howe says he'll defy state Democratic leaders and stay in the race for re-election despite two convictions for so liciting sex.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howe’s wife Marlene, her hand on his shoulder, expressed support for her<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; husband’s decision and belief in his innocence at a news conference Friday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If there are people out there who think he’s guilty, then I think they should start looking to their own houses, and re- member ‘judge not that ye be not judged,’”’ she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howe, who faces the prospect of campaigning with no party support or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; financing, called on voters to ‘“‘be forgiving.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘“T have said repeatedly that I know the people of Utah are fair,’’ the first- term congressman told reporters. He said he believed the campaign will be conducted on issues.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polls published in Utah have shown Howe behind either of two Republican opponents who meet in a Sept. 14 primary. His own survey of 2,700 persons who contacted his office showed that about half favored his withdrawal from the 2nd District race.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democratic Gov. Calvin L. Rampton said, ‘I think he made a mistake. He can’t be elected.’’ Utah Sen, Frank E. Moss, also a Democrat, said he was disappointed and would support a write- in candidate chosen by the party.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By law, Democrats cannot remove Howe's name from the November ballot without his consent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sources in the House say Howe has been refused campaign money from the House Democratic Campaign Com- mittee. Howe spent about $85, 000 in his 1974 campaign and said he has raised about $25,000 so far this year.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howe, arrested June 12 and charged with offering two police decoy prostitutes $20 for sex, pleaded innocent and was convicted in City Court and again on his appeal in District Court. He said he has not decided whether to appeal his case further.  |
