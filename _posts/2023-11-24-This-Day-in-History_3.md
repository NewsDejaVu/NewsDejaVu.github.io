| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — Appearing in the biggest antitrust trial in a quarter century, DuckDuckGo founder Gabriel Weinberg testified Thursday that it was hard for his small search engine company to compete with Google because the powerhouse has deals with phone companies and equipment manufacturers to make its product the default search option on so many devices.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We hit an obstacle with Google’s contracts,’' Weinberg said in U.S. District Court in Washington.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Department of Justice argues that Google has smothered competition by paying companies such as Apple and Verizon to lock in its search engine as the default choice — the first one users see — on many laptops and smartphones. Google counters that it dominates the internet search market because its product is better than the competition.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when it holds the default spot on smartphones and other devices, Google argues, users can switch to rival search engines with a couple of clicks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Weinberg testified that getting use ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/google-antitrust-trial-search-engine-duckduckgo-b3d81d41a5cbf8d7c2cef824663f1f8a](https://apnews.com/article/google-antitrust-trial-search-engine-duckduckgo-b3d81d41a5cbf8d7c2cef824663f1f8a) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — The American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the Justice Department say they will hold talks to adjust the proposed break-up of the Bell System to meet the demands of a federal judge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the two sides can modify their agreement, U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene said he will proceed with the antitrust settlement. The proposed corporate reorganization is the largest in history.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Greene, who described the overall AT&T divestiture plan as ‘‘plainly in the public interest,’’ said he would resume the company’s antitrust trial promptly if the two parties don’t make the changes he wants within 15 days.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial in the 1974 antitrust suit was suspended in January when AT&T and federal prosecutors announced they had reached a settlement in which AT&T would give up ownership of its 22 wholly owned Bell System companies,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exchange the telecommunications giant would be given the right to enter new, unregulated businesses like data processing and the government would drop its suit against the company.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Bell companies represent about two-thirds of AT&T’s assets — or more than $80 billion — the settlement would leave the company its lucrative long-distance, equipment, manufac- turing and research operations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greene said he approved of the settlement, but would insist on major changes to bolster the Bell System companies to help them avoid major rate increases,  |
