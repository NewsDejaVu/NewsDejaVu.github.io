| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of Elon Musk’s biggest business clients are rethinking their relationship with his tech empire amid a fresh spurt of controversial behavior. Now, so is Congress. Since Musk parroted antisemitic tropes and boosted a debunked conspiracy theory about child sex trafficking, some lawmakers are calling for the federal government to reevaluate its relationship with the tech mogul, whose companies receive billions of dollars in federal contracts.

Sens. Estes Kefauver, Tenn., and Wayne Morse, Ore., planned<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to introduce a bill that would cre-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ate a $500 million communications satellite authority. The principal and interest would be repaid from the system’s proceeds. According to Kefauver, it would operate like the Tennessee Valley Authority. President Kennedy already has ‘asked Congress to create a pri- vately owned corporation to oper- ate the space communications system. The Senate Space Com- mittee has scheduled hearings ‘starting Tuesday on the adminis- tration measure and on one simi- lar to it introduced by Committee song Robert S. Kerr of Okla-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;homa.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kefauver, in a speech prepared for Senate delivery, described the field of space communications as a natural resource. He said the federal government “is the only entity in our country with exper- ‘ience in the opefation of a world- wide communications system.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other congressional news:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farm: The Chamber of Com- merce charged that the adminis- tration, through its proposed farm plan, was trying to force produc-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Continued on Page 2, Col. 2)  |
