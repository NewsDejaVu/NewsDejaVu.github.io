| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demise of political party bosses and the smoke-filled rooms in which they operated was heralded a long time ago as an important step toward handing more power over the selection of presidential nominees to ordinary citizens. Who would have thought then that billionaires would seek to become the new bosses of American politics?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Super-wealthy individuals receive outsize attention in presidential politics. And virtually every prospective candidate wants the support of a well-funded super PAC and the vocal backing of the mega rich. The defection of a disenchanted billionaire is treated as bad news for any candidate. But what difference does all this make?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last week, Americans for Prosperity, part of the political network of billionaire industrialist Charles Koch, endorsed Nikki Haley in her bid to become the Republican nominee. The endorsement was heralded as a major coup for the former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina governor, who has been gaining in the polls.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/02/billionaires-presidential-politics-power/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/02/billionaires-presidential-politics-power/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — New York Gov. Nelson A. Rockefel- ler says a move now by Repub- lican governors to line up be- hind a single contender for the GOP presidential nomination could rupture their unity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said the governors are “doing the only good thing they could do” to preserve unity by concentrating on potential cam- paign issues rather than getting involved in endorsing someone for the nomination.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rockefeller sharply disputed Monday the assertion of Rep. Melvin R. Laird, R-Wis., that the 26 GOP governors made a mistake and sacrificed their in- fluence on the presidential nom- ination by failing to agree on a candidate during their meeting last week in Palm Beach, Fla.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You mean like the Republi- cans in Congress?” the New York governor said, ‘‘Have the Republicans in Congress taken.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a position on a candidate?”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laird acknowledged the par- ty’s House leadership has not picked one man to back. He said it’s for the 1968 candidate who could be most effective in help- ing to win congressional seats.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ “The governors have worked together as they never have be- fore,’ Rockefeller. said. “They're doing the only good thing they could do to keep unit- ed and that is by concentrating on problems—not people.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rockefeller for months has urged his fellow Republican governors to align behind the candidacy of Michigan Gov. George Romney. He said if that becomes possible, fine. ‘If they can’t—let’s be realistic,” the New Yorker said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The more united we are on the platform, the more effective we'll be on anything else,”’ Rockefeller told newsmen after a meeting of the Republican Coordinating Committee.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhode Island Gov. John H., Chafee, also a Romney suppor- ter, said the GOP governors will be a powerful factor in the se- lection of a nominee.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They will have a great deal of influence with the various delegations,’ Chafee said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I think it was obvious right from the beginning that you weren't going to have unanimity on a candidate,’’ said Gov. Dan- iel J. Evans of Washington.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the governors ap- pear undecided on backing a single candidate, the public’s fa- vorite by a decisive margin, the Harris poll reported, is Richard M. Nixon,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newest survey by Louis Harris, copyrighted by The Washington Post, shows Nixon leading Rockefeller 52 to 33 per cent; Romney, 63 to 24 per cent; and Gov, Ronald Reagan of Cal-: ifornia, 65 to 22 per cent.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the poll also showed Nix- on has slipped behind President Johnson in popularity. In early: November Nixon led Johnson 48   to 41 per cent. Now it’s Johnson: by 47 to 44 per cent.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nixon, who moved to New: York after losing the California gubernatorial election in 1962, attended a major GOP fund- raising affair Monday night for the first time since his move.  |
