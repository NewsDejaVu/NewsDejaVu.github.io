| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PARIS (AP) — Three days before the start of the 2024 Olympics France’s interior minister said about 1000 people suspected of possibly meddling for a foreign power have been blocked from attending the Olympics — one of the security challenges that Paris is cracking down on in its goal to keep Games safe for athletes and fans. About 1 million background checks have scrutinized Olympic volunteers workers and others involved in the Games as well as those applying for passes to enter the most tight security zones. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/france-paris-olympics-olympic-games-security-e8f9b8812dc06dae22ffdfad9d15858e)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOKYO (UPI) — A member of Communist Hungarys Olympic team and two Hungarian tourists defected to the U.S. Embassy left Tokyo tonight for political asylum in the United States. Reliable sources said the athlete was a member of Hungarys canoeing team in the Olympics which end Saturday. The other two were tourists who had come to see the Olympics. U.S. officials were silent but Japanese police identified the athlete as Andras Toro. He had placed fourth in the canoeing singles event. He was the first athlete from a Communist nation to defect during the current Olympics. Sources close to airport officials identified the tourists as Denes Kovacs and Karoly Molnar. The three contacted the embassy individually it was learned. The defections were not part of an organized conspiracy. Despite Japanese police fears of mass defections during the Olympic Games there has been only one other reported case thus far. A Soviet merchant seaman from a Russian tourist vessel anchored in Tokyo harbor defected to the United States the week before the games opened. The Russians are known to have sent home one of their interpreters after other Russians said he had been speaking about defecting. With the Olympics ending Sunday the present period is considered the most likely for defections because many of the athletes have finished competition and are on their own. Russia and Cuba have taken precautions against this possibility by flying their athletes home as soon as possible after their events are completed. |

| Chicken Wings Advertised As Boneless Can Have Bones Ohio Supreme Court Decides | Birds Without Wings The Latest Thing In Chicken Raising; 400 In Flock |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers cannot expect boneless chicken wings to actually be free of bones a divided Ohio Supreme Court ruled Thursday rejecting claims by a restaurant patron who suffered serious medical complications from getting a bone stuck in his throat. Michael Berkheimer was dining with his wife and friends at a wing joint in Hamilton Ohio and had ordered the usual — boneless wings with parmesan garlic sauce — when he felt a bite-size piece of meat go down the wrong way. Three days later feverish ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/boneless-chicken-wings-lawsuit-ohio-supreme-court-231002ea50d8157aeadf093223d539f8)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Des Moines Iowa July 7 - Wingless chickens have been developed by Peter H. Baumann of Des Moines after 12 years of selective breeding. Baumann 32 has about 400 of the wingless chickens. The advantages? Well for one thing Baumann says his birds have white meat where others have only bony wings. It makes them better eating. And besides no high fence is needed to keep the chickens in the yard. The birds cant fly at all and Baumann says they can only “high jump” 18 to 20 inches. A two-foot barrier is high enough. Baumann reports the chickens lay an average number of eggs but he says in time he expects the breed will out-lay other chickens as well as produce more meat. The reason is that the energy an ordinary chicken wastes in “useless flapping and flying about can be utilized in production of meat and eggs.” Lack of wings also makes the drumsticks bigger. That according to the raiser is because the chicken’s upper leg has to work harder to hold the bird upright. The breed isnt perfect yet. Baumann still gets about five chickens with stubby little wings out of every 100. These are carefully weeded out of the breeding stock. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEIR AL-BALAH Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes hit a school used by displaced Palestinians in central Gaza on Saturday killing at least 30 people including several children as the country’s negotiators prepared to meet international mediators about a proposed cease-fire. Seven children and seven women were among the dead taken from the girls’ school in Deir al-Balah to Al Aqsa Hospital. Israel’s military said it targeted a Hamas command center used to direct attacks against Israeli troops ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-palestinians-evacuation-27-july-2024-c95e8effebd9d4e4ba7e69bfbae61e04)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel has appealed to Egypt for an end to war an end to bloodshed but Israeli jets raided southern Lebanon for the second time this week in retaliation for Palestinian guerrilla gunfire. Egypt cautiously welcomed the Jewish state’s plea for peace and Arab foreign ministers gathered in northern Africa to decide their next move. Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin in an unprecedented move in the history of the Middle East conflict broadcast his remarks to the Egyptian people Friday only two days after Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in a dramatic gesture offered to go to Jerusalem for peace talks. We the Israelis stretch out our hand to you Begin said in his five-minute prepared statement aired on national radio and television and beamed to the Arab countries. Quoting from the Koran and invoking the name of our common father Abraham Begin called not only for peace but for a start on the road of friendship. We do not want any clashes with you he said. Let us say one to another and let it be a silent oath by both peoples of Egypt and Israel: No more wars no more bloodshed and no more threats. But as he spoke Israeli warplanes struck southern Lebanon for the second time in three days in response to Palestinian missile attacks. An Israeli army spokesman said the planes on a reconnaissance mission over the region where a massive bombardment Wednesday killed at least 100 people destroyed a missile position south of the biblical city of Tyre. Hospital reports in Lebanon listed 14 people injured but Palestinian guerrilla spokesmen said their anti-aircraft and SAM-7 missiles kept the planes at high altitude and eventually forced them back to Israel. They said they had called a full military alert because of Wednesdays raid. You can bet we were ready a spokesman said. Earlier Israeli gunners responded to a guerrilla pocket attack on the frontier kibbutz of Yiron with a heavy barrage. There was damage to the kibbutz but no casualties were reported. Israeli planes Friday also attempted to attack Nabatiyeh in the southeast but Palestinian officials said they were turned back. In Cairo Egypt cautiously welcomed Begin’s appeal for peace. This call in itself is welcomed by Egypt which has always made a strong plea for peace a government spokesman said. |

| New Prosthetics Restore Natural Movement Via Nerve Connection | Old Idea Of ‘Hopeless’ Cripples Goes Overboard In Face Of Dramatic Evidence Of Competence In Use Of Artificial Legs |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of prosthetics a groundbreaking advancement is changing the game for individuals with lower-limb amputations. Researchers at MIT in collaboration with Brigham and Women\s Hospital have developed a neuroprosthetic system that allows users to control their prosthetic legs using their own nervous systems. This innovative approach could bring us closer to a future of fully integrated naturally controlled artificial limbs. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/new-prosthetics-restore-natural-movement-via-nerve-connection)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON March 23—Some “hopeless” cripples showed today why there’s plenty of room for any handicapped person to have hope. A man with one leg ran a credible 60-yard dash. A man with only two stumps for legs and with no control over either stump not only walked but climbed a stair. A man who had put on the second of his two artificial legs only a month ago walked jauntily across the room. This was part of a demonstration at the national conference on workmens compensation and rehabilitation. It illustrated a change that has come over the thinking on the proper treatment for cripples. In the old days a man with no legs for example was taught a job in which he needed no legs. Now the theory is to give him legs— and teach him to stand both literally and figuratively on his own two feet. Dr. Henry H. Kessler of West Orange N. J. and Dr. Josephine J. Buchanan of Fisherville Va showed what hard work and patience on the part of both the patients and the doctors can do. Charles Cook 30 of Keen Mountain Va. hurt his back in a mine accident in 1943. Paralyzed from the hips down he couldnt walk for five years. Then the United Mine Workers’ welfare fund paid for an operation and for instruction at the Fisherville Woodrow Wilson rehabilitation center. “Charlie fell down in the hotel today” Dr. Buchanan said “and everyone rushed to pick him up. ‘Leave him alone’ I said ‘Charlie can get up by himself.” Charlie got up by himself. Earl Fink a handsome mustached 33-year-old from Harrisburgh Pa. lost both legs in an automobile accident three years ago. He got one artificial leg Jan. 27 the other only a month ago. Yet he walked confidently and jauntily across the room. Among Dr. Kessler’s helpers were Ben Combs of Hazard Ky. and Donald Kerr a product of New Orleans. Combs lost both legs in a mine accident five years ago when he was only 17. In addition he was paralyzed and had no control over the short stumps. Yet today he managed his crutches and body so well that he swung his legs along and then climbed some stairs. Kerr was the prize exhibit. He lost a leg when he was just nine yet he captained the Tulane fencing team dances plays tennis and badminton roller skates high jumps. It was he who ripped through the 60-yard dash. Kerr said that as a youngster he walked four and a half miles to school cut grass and ran errands despite his artificial leg. And he told this story: “A neighbor came to my mother and said ‘Youre a fiend Mrs. Kerr.’ My mother replied ‘Tell me how does my boy act?’ ‘Perfectly normal’ said the neighbor. ‘All right.’ said my mother ‘hes perfectly normal and Im a fiend’.” Everybody got the point. |

Pickets made no effort to molest those running their lines. It was uncertain however if the movie stars would pass the picket lines at Paramount R. K. O. Columbia and other studios. Their guild left the matter up to the individual. They will not report for work until later. The major studios apparently determined to continue production despite the strike of 2500 craftsmen in three unions slipped several truckloads of men inside the gates at dawn for later other trucks loaded with workmen were permitted to pass without opposition. There were but 18 pickets at the main gate of the Paramount lot. There were 10 each at Columbia and R. K. O. The strike order affecting film painters scenic artists and makeup men became effective at 6:00 oclock Friday evening after being called by the Federated Motion Picture Crafts. A conference between union leaders and producers’ representatives previously ended in a deadlock arising from refusal to recognize bargaining rights. It was reported the striking groups are without the support of the strong older unions which are members of the so-called basic studio agreement. These unions include the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners the musicians International Brotherhood of Electric Workers and the Truck Drivers Chauffeurs and Teamsters’ Union all affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PARIS – One of the most decorated members of the Great Britain Olympic delegation has withdrawn from the 2024 Paris Olympics following an equine-abuse investigation. Equestrian athlete Charlotte Dujardin a three-time Olympic gold medalist in dressage announced the news Tuesday after a video she said was from four years ago surfaced and showed her acting “completely out of character.” The International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) investigation resulted in a six-month suspension ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/23/olympics-2024-charlotte-dujardin-out-paris/74514423007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MEXICO CITY (AP) — The U.S. Olympic Committee suspended star sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos from the U.S. Olympic team after midnight Thursday for untypical exhibitionism during an Olympic victory ceremony Wednesday. The decision followed a complaint by the International Olympic Committee regarding the conduct of Smith when he received the gold medal for winning the 200-meter event and Carlos when he was presented the bronze medal for finishing third in the 200-meter finals Wednesday. Both Smith and Carlos raised clenched fists clothed in black gloves during the playing of the Star Spangled Banner and also wore black knee socks without shoes during the presentation ceremony. They also wore identical buttons on their team uniforms citing demands for racial equality. Two members of the U.S Olympic Committees board of consultants John Sayre a rower in the 1960 Olympics and Billy Mills the 10000-meter winner in 1964 went to the Olympic Village after midnight to notify Smith and Carlos to leave. The statement from the U.S. Olympic Committee said that any repetition of such incidents by other members of the U.S. team can only be considered a willful disregard of Olympic principles that would warrant the imposition of the severest penalties at the disposal of the U.S. Olympic Committee. The statement expressed profound regrets to the IOC the Mexican Organizing Committee and to the people of Mexico for the discourtesy displayed by two members of this team in departing from tradition during a victory ceremony at the Olympic Stadium Oct 16. This action is necessary in belief such immature behavior is an isolated incident. However if further investigation or subsequent events do not bear out this view the entire matter will be re-evaluated. |

| Will Netanyahu Visit Lead To Progress In A Cease-Fire Agreement Between Israel And Hamas? | Kissinger In Jerusalem; Reassures Nervous Israel |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu kicks off a high-profile visit to Washington that includes an address to Congress and meetings with top officials the issue that has been at the forefront of U.S.-Israel relations − a Gaza-war cease-fire − may seem elusive.

Kissinger arrived in Jerusalem today and reassured a nervous Israel that he would not work against its security or apply pressure in seeking a peace settlement on the embattled Golan Heights. Israeli-Syrian fighting on the Heights entered its 52nd day. Kissinger’s task appeared to be growing more difficult by the minute. The Syrian leadership has stated that fighting will continue until Israel withdraws from all captured Arab territory including the Golan Heights. Israel refuses but has offered to give up territory captured in October. Youthful Israeli demonstrators chanting and carrying signs against Israeli concessions were outside his hotel when Kissinger arrived in Jerusalem. There also were anti-Kissinger demonstrations in Damascus Wednesday where gun-carrying students in a May Day parade denounced Kissinger as a ‘cheap American a Jewish conspirator.’ On the war front the Israeli command said its jets strafed Syrian positions around Mt. Hermon and carried out artillery duels with Syrian guns on the Heights below. The Israelis also reported their jets attacked an Arab guerrilla concentration in Lebanese territory on the western slopes of Mt. Hermon where the Israelis came under fire Wednesday. Syrian communiques said a Syrian patrol destroyed three Israeli tanks and their occupants with hand grenades and light weapons. Kissinger said on arrival ‘I come here not to discuss concessions but to discuss security. The issue is not pressure but a lasting peace. He immediately began a series of meetings with caretaker Prime Minister Golda Meir Defense Secretary Moshe Dayan and Foreign Minister Abba Eban. On Friday Kissinger flies to Damascus. London diplomatic reports said Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko also would visit Damascus shortly to inject Soviet presence into the next phase of Middle East peace strategy. Gromyko pledged cooperation in talks with Kissinger in Geneva Sunday and Monday —but the Syrian line remained tough. |
