His name was not among those mentioned during months of speculation about the coach the Falcons would choose to build their new team.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecker was named by Falcon owner Rankin Smith, who said the Green Bay assistant would serve only as head coach and not as general manager.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecker was given a four-year contract, Smith said. Terms were not announced,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Falcon coach has been with the Packers since 1959, and helped coach Green Bay to NFL championships in 1961, 1962 and 1955.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecker was named to the Atlanta job in preference to more widely known candidates, including former NFL _ head coaches Red Hickey, George Wilson and Buddy Parker. Smith also tried to get Hecker’s boss at Green Bay, Vince Lom- bardi.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlanta was highly successful in landing its drafted choices of college players without a coach, and lost only one to the rival American Football League.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Hecker’'s first duties will be to select players from other NFL clubs at a league meeting next month, when the Falcons will be allowed to pick 42 experienced men from the 14 established teams.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Of all the people I talked with -—- and there were a lot of them — Norb Hecker impressed me the most,’’ Smith said. “I know Vinee Lombardi thinks a lot of him.”   Smith said he had to choose between experience and youth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I decided I didn’t want a re- tread,” he said. ‘I know Norb is a young fellow with a big chal- lenge, but he realizes this and he is ready to go.”  |
