(AP) - Communist sympathizers, encouraged by the relaxed security policies of University of California President Clark Kerr, controlled recent student uprisings at the UC Berkeley campus, a state Senate committee said today. The committee blamed Kerr's 'tolerance of radical student groups' and policy of 'opening the campus to Communist officialsâ€™ for precipitating the crisis that 'let a minority of Communist leaders bring this great education institution to its knees.' The report was signed by two of the three members of the Committee on Un-American Activities - Senate President Pro Tem Hugh M. Burns and Sen. Aaron W. Quick. The third member, Sen. Stephen P. Teale, wouldn't sign and withheld comment 'at this time.' He voted against a measure Thursday night that would have authorized a legislative investigation of the university. |
