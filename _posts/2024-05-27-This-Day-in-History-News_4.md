| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technology behind self-driving cars has been around for quite some time. However its commercialization – from companies offering and operating ride-share services to those selling self-driving cars – is still rather new. One well-known taxi company is Waymo which despite its successes is now under federal investigation due to traffic safety concerns. So what do you need to know about this investigation? Is Waymo still considered safe? What about other self-driving cars? Is it time to g ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/federal-probe-targets-waymos-robotaxis-amid-traffic-safety-concerns)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DETROIT (AP) — Dozens of motorists have been run over dragged and crushed against buildings by their Ford cars trucks and vans. Six were killed 39 others injured. Federal safety investigators want to know why. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has started an investigation of 5.3 million Ford vehicles assembled from 1973 to 1978 which may have automatic transmissions that shift on their own from park into reverse. According to the agencys files the apparent defect may have been responsible for at least 114 accidents in the past five years. According to a Ford document supplied to the agency last month the company knew of 171 accidents 72 injuries and five deaths allegedly attributable to inadvertent transmission shifting in models containing C-6 transmissions since their 1966 introduction. Because there are deaths and accidents and injuries and they all seem to have a relationship to the automatic transmission it appears that there is an alleged defect said Lynn Bradford head of the safety agencys office of defects investigation. The agency said Ford was not ordered to recall any of the vehicles because the apparent defect has not been precisely identified. The investigation involves Ford Torinos Elites Thunderbirds and LTD Hs. Mercury Montegos Cougars and Lincolns and F100 F150 F250 F350 Econoline. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON – Democrats risk splitting again as House Republican leaders prepare legislation to sanction International Criminal Court officials for seeking arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials. The ICC’s decision on Monday to pursue arrest warrants against Netanyahu and his allies over Israel’s conduct in the war in Gaza has sparked bipartisan fury from Washington with both Republicans and Democrats condemning the ICC. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/22/democrats-splitting-icc-gop-congress-sanctions/73805052007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNITED NATIONS (UPI) — U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young says he favors imposing some form of sanction against the white government of South Africa to force it to yield to international pressure for racial reform. Young made the remark to reporters Monday after leaving a Security Council meeting where African delegates angered by a South African crackdown on dissent demanded a comprehensive arms and economic embargo against Pretoria. Asked if he favored some sort of sanctions against South Africa Young replied: “Yes I guess I do.” The outspoken diplomat made it clear this was his personal view and the final decision would be made by Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and President Carter. But Young’s statement could embarrass the United States and other Western powers who fear that slapping an embargo on South Africa could jeopardize negotiations under way to bring majority rule to Rhodesia and independence to South West Africa also known as Namibia. Young trying to head off a confrontation with the black African nations said the United States was in ‘‘a very good position to come up with a draft resolution that we can all agree on.” In South Africa Monday police wounded one black youth and arrested 66 others in demonstrations across the nation. Relations between Washington and Pretoria already strained by the American ambassador’s return to Washington for consultations dipped further Monday in a dispute over South Africa’s development of nuclear power. The State Department said Prime Minister John Vorster ‘‘formally assured” Carter twice in the past month his country would not develop nuclear explosives but Vorster said Sunday in a television interview he was “not aware’”’ of any such promise. In the Security Council debate Tunisian Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri who spoke on behalf of African delegates said South Africa’s decision last week to shut down two top black newspapers disband 18 opposition groups and arrest dozens of critics showed that the time for tougher Security Council action had come. “Events of the few past days have exposed the true intentions of South Africa” he said. A spokesman for the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) said Britain France and the United States who have previously vetoed attempts to impose sanctions on South Africa must realize that ‘‘Vorster is no mere juvenile delinquent to be treated with mild rebuke. ‘“‘He murders in cold blood and blackmails openly’’ David Sibeko said. ‘‘He is a dangerous gangster. “The justice demanded by the people (of) Azania from the international community a community which has declared apartheid a crime against humanity cannot be further delayed if the spill of blood in our country and across its borders .. (is to) be minimized.” |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately phishing scams seem to be the new normal. Most recently an elderly woman in the tri-state area almost got scammed for $25000. According to Patch.com what began as an average phishing scam turned even more sinister when the scammer turned up at this elderly victims house to retrieve money physically. While this Geek Squad scam is part of an elaborate phishing scheme the scammer was caught. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/dont-fall-email-scam-almost-cost-elderly-woman-25k)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — If youre looking for a quick way to get rich lose weight grow hair remove wrinkles or become a better lover youre a target for a fast-growing half-billion dollar industry — mail fraud. Postal Service officials say the swindle-by-mail business is so sophisticated it has developed a legitimate offshoot. One promoter is peddling the names of his best customers a prime sucker list. Anyone looking for a start in swindling can purchase the list legally. That way he doesnt have to drum up his own clientele. Officials responsible for policing mail fraud say it is both diverse and booming. The variety of stuff around is amazing said George Davis assistant general counsel for the Post Office. The Postal Service estimates swindlers who made about $194 million two years ago upped their take to at least $514 million in fiscal 1976. Postal authorities stress that most of the $60 billion-a-year mail order industry is reputable. But they warn consumers to be suspicious of products and direct-mail offers that seem too good to be true. Recent examples include a cream to “quickly enlarge the bustline up to five times while sleeping’ and a ‘youth mask guaranteed to produce the ‘equivalent to a miniature face-lift’. Unscrupulous promoters have used the mails to sell the public worthless diet pills fake medical devices phony investment plans pseudo cures for baldness and impotency so-called aphrodisiacs and fake devices to remove wrinkles and increase the length of fingernails. Another outfit advertised executive job openings in a nonexistent chain of supermarkets. One rip-off artist had a religious twist soliciting priests for donations to help win canonization of John Neumann a 19th century Philadelphia bishop who already had been chosen for sainthood. To combat mail-order promoters who advertise falsely or who fail to furnish the product they promise the Postal Service can stop delivering them their mail cutting off the supply of cash. Or it can move under the nation’s oldest consumer protection law the 1872 mail fraud law to seek jail terms against the operators. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families of the victims of the massacre at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde Texas on Wednesday announced a $2 million settlement with the city as well as a lawsuit against the Texas Department of Public Safety and 92 named troopers who were involved in the mishandled law enforcement response to one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. The suit contends the officers received active shooter training but failed to follow national standards and best practices. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/22/uvalde-cisd-police-chief-resigns-school-shooting/73800080007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPRINGFIELD Ill (AP) — The man who was frequently the center of criticism as the chief of Illinois’ ‘Little FBI” has resigned his post abruptly for a role in an even larger controversy: the one surrounding the death of two Black Panthers in a Chicago police raid 19 months ago. Mitchell Ware 37 was asked Thursday night after the unexpected late-hour announcement by the governor’s office of his resignation whether he might return to the post of superintendent of the Illinois Bureau of Investigation. “Law enforcement has taken a lot of lumps” he added. Gov. Richard B. Ogilvie who had borne the brunt of criticism from legislators and university officials following Wares spectacular series of campus drug raids was unavailable for comment. Wares immediate superior law enforcement Director Herbert D. Brown said he had no ideas of a possible successor to Ware. Earlier Judge Joseph A. Power of Cook County Circuit Court offered Ware the job of probing charges that ‘grand jurors who returned indictments in the Panther case were unduly influenced by the special prosecutor. “I was going to take a leave of absence with no pay” Ware told a newsman who reached him by telephone following the resignation. ‘That way I wouldnt be obligated to anybody. Ogilvie’s office said Ware was told he could not investigate the Panther case for the court while remaining chief of the IBI. In the predawn raid Dec. 4 1969. Illinois Panther chairman Fred Hampton 21 and Peoria Panther Mark Clark 22 were fatally shot by Chicago police on special assignment to the Cook County state’s attorney’s office. Veteran trial lawyer Barnabas Sears conducted the grand jury probe of charges that public officials interfered with evidence in the case. Although the jury returned indictments reportedly naming States Atty. Edward V. Hanrahan on a charge of obstructing justice Judge Power suppressed them after some of the policemen accused Sears of pressuring the jurors. It was this aspect of the case that Ware was appointed to investigate. Ware became head of Ogilvie’s newly created elite investigative task force—and the ranking black man in Illinois law enforcement—in July 1969. Almost as soon as he took charge of the IBI he became a focus on controversy. He freely acknowledged that his undercover agents were roaming the universities saying ‘“There’s a real uproar when we put the squeeze on some rich kids on college campuses but there’s never any uproar when we nail a ghetto kid.” Some members of the General Assembly charged Ware with “gestapo tactics but he brushed aside these critics as ‘‘do-gooders’ In a speech at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb Ware said “The classroom has no more sanctity than the poolroom. I’m sick and tired of pseudo-liberals.” |
