| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washington (CNN) — The presidents of Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are facing questions from Congress Tuesday about their responses to alleged incidents of antisemitism on their campuses in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As you confront our questions in this hearing, remember that you are not speaking to us, but to the students on your campus who have been threatened and assaulted and who look to you to protect them,” she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, Foxx invited Harvard president Claudine Gay, Penn president Liz Magill and MIT president Sally Kornbluth to testify.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“After the events of the past two months, it is clear that rabid antisemitism and the university are two ideas that cannot be cleaved from one another,” Foxx said<br><br>Read the full article at [here](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/05/politics/harvard-penn-mit-antisemitism-congress/index.html). | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (UPI) - The Senate’s chief investigator of campus riots has accused a university president of applying a "double standard" under which lawbreaking students are immune from criminal laws applied to everyone else.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where do you draw the line?" Sen. John L. McClellan, D-Ark., thundered at Stanford University President Kenneth S. Pitzer. "They commit murder out there—you're going to handle it?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, of course not," Pitzer replied. "But there are categories of things which are technically violations of the law that are better dealt with by campus authorities."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exchange during a Senate hearing highlighted a sharp disagreement between defenders of campus autonomy, who contend college authorities might spark more violence by calling police, and critics who say students have no right to be treated as a special breed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House Tuesday, another aspect of the campus problem reached a climax. A band of Democrats on the House Education Committee managed to kill a bill to cut off federal aid from colleges which did not give the government indications they had plans to handle campus unrest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rep. Edith Green, D-Ore., backer of the measure, said it was a mild step intended to act as a buffer against possible repressive anticampus legislation which might come up from the House floor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But liberal Democrats viewed the measure in the same light as other 'repressive' suggestions and banded together to kill it. Members of the committee disagreed among themselves whether the door would now be open for more stringent attempts at legislation to control student violence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stanford president, testifying Tuesday before McClellan’s investigating subcommittee, said local police agreed to let Stanford mete out academic justice to more than 200 students involved in two building seizures in April. He acknowledged the students smashed windows, damaged machinery, rifled files, and even stole two electric typewriters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But McClellan said it amounted to a "double standard" under which students get a privilege given no one else. "Where there is violence, actual crime, I wonder about the colleges applying the law as they see it," he told Pitzer. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dec 7 (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee opened an investigation into three of the country's most prestigious universities on Thursday, two days after lawmakers expressed dissatisfaction with the school presidents' testimony about addressing antisemitism.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce said in a statement it planned to investigate the learning environments and disciplinary policies at Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).<br><br>Read the full article [here](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-committee-opens-investigation-into-harvard-penn-mit-after-antisemitism-2023-12-07/). | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Communist sympathizers, encouraged by the relaxed security policies of University of California President Clark Kerr, controlled recent student uprisings at the UC Berkeley campus, a state Senate committee said today. The committee blamed Kerr's 'tolerance of radical student groups' and policy of 'opening the campus to Communist officials’ for precipitating the crisis that 'let a minority of Communist leaders bring this great education institution to its knees.' The report was signed by two of the three members of the Committee on Un-American Activities - Senate President Pro Tem Hugh M. Burns and Sen. Aaron W. Quick. The third member, Sen. Stephen P. Teale, wouldn't sign and withheld comment 'at this time.' He voted against a measure Thursday night that would have authorized a legislative investigation of the university. |
