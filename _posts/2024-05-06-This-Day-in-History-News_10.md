| Are These Robots Making Humans Obsolete For Home And Repair Tasks? | Short Squat Ugly Robot May Replace Semi-Skilled Laborers By The Thousands |

But more important the fat “man” soon may replace semi-skilled laborers by the thousands. Series 10 so-called is an example of a third-generation robot — 18 inches high 6 feet in diameter and complete with ‘‘sight sensors and two arms that have fingers grippers wrist movement and elbow movement” says Bernard Sallot executive director of the Robot Institute of America. A relatively simple model the robot was on display this week at the first North American Industrial Robot Conference demonstrating its ability to sort a deck of cards. The manufacturer Auto-Place Inc. of Troy Mich. said the robot can be programmed to play poker ‘‘so the house would be unbeatable” but it said the cost to do that would be prohibitive. Counterparts though soon will replace thousands of semi-skilled workers — perhaps hundreds of thousands of them — in factory jobs Sallot said in an interview. In less than a decade robots will be common in manufacturing said Sallot who predicts the robot industry’s sales will increase from $18 million this year to as much as $50 million in 1977. Once found only in science fiction robots have progressed rapidly since the early 1960s. In the United States about 6000 industrial robots perform such tasks as heavy lifting welding die-casting and paint-spraying in auto and electrical industries and other smaller businesses. “And that figure is rapidly becoming academic. Theres a tremendous backlog of orders’’ for the robots that cost from a few thousand dollars to more than $100000 Sallot said. Abroad especially in countries like Japan and Sweden governments have funded robot research. Today’s most complex models possess ‘movement sight or pattern recognition the ability to identify certain objects by feel and the ability to respond to simple voice commands”’ said Sallot. Future robots he added could completely automate factories. Tony Connole a retired United Auto Workers official attending the conference said industrys use of robots is inevitable: ‘‘You can’t stop technology. That would be a long-term mistake. He said unions with individual employers and government should try to ‘minimize the impact of displacement of human labor by robots.” Sallot maintained that labor leaders wary of potential job loss through use of robots are “realists.” “They recognize that U.S. productivity must keep up with production abroad” he said. ‘In the final analysis financial benefits are shared by labor as well as business.” In another sense he said the robot industry is promoting use of mechanical men “in work that is notoriously hazardous dirty boring heavy and tiring.” |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BAGHDAD (AP) — Human rights groups and diplomats criticized a law that was quietly passed by the Iraqi parliament over the weekend that would impose heavy prison sentences on gay and transgender people. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement that the law passed Saturday “threatens those most at risk in Iraqi society” and “can be used to hamper free-speech and expression.” He warned that the legislation could drive away foreign investment. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/iraq-lgbtq-law-85e5e55cde7a581631c484ad83b0773c)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prussian government alarmed by what it considers a thorough collapse of German Morals today issued a manifesto aimed to provide punishment for lax customs on public bathing beaches and in nudist camps. The police were authorized to prescribe suitable bathing costumes and were cautioned to exercise rigorous control over them. The decree banned nude bathing and provided penalties for any person found bathing in an improper costume. Nude or improper bathing the government declared in its one concession to the nudists shall be considered public and therefore punishable if the bathers can be seen from a roadway or from the water. The manifesto forbids morally reprehensible behavior in and on the water and prohibits men and women from entering restaurants while wearing only bathing suits. Persons found guilty of violating the new code of morals will be subject to a fine of approximately $35. A supplementary manifesto ordered that performers in theaters and night clubs may not bare their bodies at the cost of public morals and all performances must be prevented if when ostensibly serving an artistic purpose they actually are being staged for erotic purposes. All nudity on the stage shall be barred the decree continued and the appearance of women in bathing suits as participants in beauty contests is strictly forbidden. The two decrees brought an immediate storm of protests from the German Baltic bathing resorts. |

| Zebra Remains On The Loose In Washington State Officials Close Trailheads | Animals On The Loose Across The Nation |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEATTLE (AP) — A zebra that escaped from a trailer east of Seattle last weekend remained on the lam Friday as authorities closed off trailheads at a nature area in hopes of keeping people away and easing her capture. The zebra was one of four that escaped as they were being transported from Washington to Montana last Sunday. The driver had taken the Interstate 90 exit for North Bend in the Cascade mountain foothills about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Seattle to secure the trailer when t ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/zebra-missing-washington-state-2f46a5c4e344f385ba11e3ad2ae41c87)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capybaras took to the hills and a wallaroo got loose in California elephants were on parade in Meadville Pa. and a prize bull went after some sheriffs deputies in Lima Ohio. In fact animals all over the country seem to be escaping these days causing trouble for cops and zookeepers. Frank Coghlan of the Los Angeles Zoo says most escapes are the result of poor security but believes that some animals who get out get lonesome after a while and return to the zoo. However others dont come back on their own. Like Lilly and Isa two elephants who recently led authorities on a three-week chase through the grasslands of Oklahoma. Then there was an ocelot named Mommy who was on the loose for five days in New York City before being captured by police. She bit one cop on the knee before giving up. And in Chicago police say they havent heard from Kinky the kangaroo since mid-July when a housewife in central Illinois reported seeing him. Kinky you will remember allegedly attacked two policemen in the Chicago area last winter. But since no one has reported a 5.5-foot hopper missing some people think he is mythical. On Thursday a 1100-pound prize Charolais bull broke loose from the county fairground and blocked traffic on Interstate 75 near Lima for more than an hour. Two of the sheriffs patrol cars were gored one seriously before the angered bull was rounded up. In Fresno Calif. authorities are looking all over town for a 10-month-old 15-pound wallaroo that has been missing several days. Roeding Park zookeepers said they first realized one of 11 wallaroos was missing when a startled newspaper carrier spotted it hopping down a street. Officials theorize he was probably stolen by someone for a pet and then hopped away on his own. In Irvine Calif. animal control officers continued to comb the rolling hills of Orange County today in an attempt to locate a 40-pound rodent which escaped from Lion Country Safari. Capy the capybara an aquatic mammal from South America that grows to 4 feet in length left the park after keepers drained his watery habitat for cleaning. Capybaras the world’s largest rodents feed on water vegetation and are harmless a spokeswoman for the wildlife park said. But they may wind up in your swimming pool or other wet areas. Five other capybaras left the park Friday and all have returned to the old chow bucket she said. In Meadville Pa. three elephants ad libbed a roadside show for rubberneckers after escaping from a wrecked circus wagon Wednesday. The truck lost its brakes on Main Street and struck two utility poles a pickup truck and at least two cars before coming to rest. Everyone involved escaped serious injury. The trainer for the Clyde Beatty Cole Brothers Circus led the pachyderms out of the trailer and the town gathered to watch. |

The Viet Cong also fired on the headquarters of the 10th South Vietnamese infantry division in the provincial capital of Xuan Loc principal town in the area but apparently made no attempt to seize the town. The spokesman said casualties at Xuan Loc were light. There was no immediate report of casualties in the other attacks. The village of Gia Tan was overrun by a Communist force of undetermined size. Radio contact with the village was lost soon after it was attacked and no details were available immediately. Government defenders in Gia Kiem and the airstrip village of Tuc Trung were reported holding their own. Air Force planes bombed and strafed the Communists attacking Tuc Trung at 3 a.m. with undetermined results. The spokesman said the division headquarters was the target of a mortar barrage and harassing fire from rifles and machine guns. Xuan Loc sits astride Highway 1 35 miles east-northeast of Saigon. The other communities attacked today are strung along highway 20 in the same general area. There were indications Friday that the communists were moving strong forces into the Xuan Loc Sector. The pilot of an observation plane reported being fired on by heavy anti-aircraft guns which U.S. military authorities said the Reds would only employ in an area where they had sizable forces. |

LANGFORD CLEARWATER Fla. - A crowd of vocal mostly female supporters today forced a postponement in the trial of millionaire Glenn W. Turner on charges of violating Florida state securities laws. As the trial was to start at 9:30 a.m. prosecution and defense attorneys huddled before the bench and Circuit Court Judge William A. Patterson announced the trial would be postponed until Monday. Standing in an aisle shaking hands with well-wishers Turner said I dont have anything to do with it. Theyre going to come where I am. The women appeared in Clearwater in buses festooned with pro-Turner banners. They were put up in local hotels and treated to poolside parties Tuesday night. The women who came from states as far away as waved small American flags and placards reading such things as The Unstoppable American and Floridas Fly With Glenn Turner. They showed up at the courthouse in Clearwater about an hour before the trial started at 9:30 a.m. They had first stationed themselves on the courthouse steps but then were moved across the street by police. The flamboyant 38-year-old sharecroppers son is on trial with two associates for alleged violation of Floridas securities laws. Circuit Court Judge Patterson today led both sides through the process of selecting prospective jurors in the case. Attorney James Russ is defending the Turner Three with famed criminal lawyer F. Lee Bailey on standby. Bailey will come if he thinks its necessary Turner said before the trial. Turners legions of nattily dressed followers have followed him from the football field to the courtroom. On the eve of the trial hundreds were pouring into this Gulf city to root for him. The men wear tightly tailored double-knit suits soft leather zippered boots and jeweled American flags in their lapels. They drive the biggest cars. |

July 8 — Howard Hughes multi-millionaire sportsman was given a 50-50 chance to survive today after he crashed in his new Army Photographic plane on its initial flight. The handsome 40 year old airplane builder who also found time to make Movie Queens of the late Jean Harlow and voluptuous Jane Russell was testing his super-fast XF-11 which he designed and built for the Army. Five minutes after the takeoff last night the plane apparently developed motor trouble and came down in the center of a swanky residential district. The plane struck two homes and plowed into a $160000 mansion setting off a series of fires and explosions that rocked the neighborhood. Doctors at Good Samaritan hospital said Hughes was in very critical condition. His injuries included a broken rib which pierced his left lung a possible skull fracture broken left collar bone possible left leg fracture a badly burned left hand a broken nose and many cuts and bruises. He was conscious for hours after the crash a hospital spokesman said. Lana Turner who Hollywood gossips insist will be Mrs. Hughes before too long did not make an appearance at the hospital. Instead her mother called Hughes doctor to see how badly he was hurt. When the shiny new plane a twin-engine job with a knife-like wing began to lose altitude Hughes attempted to guide his ship to a nearby golf course. But one engine conked out and the other sputtering motor failed to make it. |

Actually it’s been a bad decade for libertarianism. “No it’s been a bad century” a devout libertarian might counter accurately enough.

In a broadcast reply to Mr. Truman’s meat decontrol address Reece declared last night: The once great political alignment that followed Jefferson and Jackson and Wilson has fallen under control—at the policy-making level—of persons who believe that government should run the people that our citizens do not have sense enough to govern themselves. Reece also conjectured that Mr. Truman might restore controls on meat as soon as the election of 1946 has passed into history. A few weeks before election the President suspends all controls over meat. This is a familiar pattern before election whether it’s meat or anything else in the field of government control he said. I mention this phase of the situation because of the manner in which the Administration has abused such powers in the past. Reece said the Democrats executed such tactics in 1944 when certain ration controls were eased before election with the explanation that the food situation had improved. So what happened? The election was held and the administration was returned to power. Almost immediately thereafter it was alleged that there had been some serious errors in the estimates of our food supplies. Controls were re-established previous ration point values were reinstated Reece said he is wondering if we are now to look forward to a re-imposition of controls following the November 5 elections. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alaska Air Group has received $61 million in supplier credit memos from Boeing as additional compensation for the hit from a temporary grounding of 737 MAX 9 jets the carrier said on Friday. The airline had received $162 million in cash as compensation from the planemaker in the first quarter. An Alaska Airlines-operated MAX 9 jet experienced a mid-air cabin panel blowout in January which led to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration grounding 171 of the aircraft for about three weeks. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2024/05/03/boeing-alaska-airlines-credit-737/73553429007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — The Air Force has grounded all its F111 swing-wing fighter-bombers for the fifth time in three years. The action was taken Friday after an investigation of the 18th crash of an F111 showed a flaw in the pilot-escape system. Two crewmen were killed in the April 23 crash near Edwards Air Force Base in California. Air Force officials said the bail-out capsule separated properly from the plane but a metal door on the recovery parachute compartment failed to blow open. The reason for the bailout is undetermined. The grounding was described as temporary pending completion of tests possibly by Monday to determine why the explosive system that knocks off the chute door failed to operate. The F111 originally the TFX has been plagued for years by production and operational problems and discontent in Congress over cost overruns. The Air Force has accepted 257 of the planes from General Dynamics the manufacturer at a cost of about $9 million each compared with original estimates of $2.8 million. The original plan to purchase 2411 of the planes has been cut back to 552. In all the F111 has been involved in 22 major accidents since January 1967 with loss of 17 planes and nine crewmen. All F111s were grounded in December 1969 when a wing fell off one in flight over Nevada and two crewmen were killed. The jets were returned to operational status only last July after a long series of stress tests. |

The crisis threatened the six point Israeli-Egyptian peace agreement. The situation was so serious that Finnish Maj. Gen. Ensio Siilasvuo commander of the U.N. Emergency Force flew to Jerusalem for talks with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan. Both had visited the flashpoints along the highway earlier in the day but only saluted each other and did not speak. Dayan met with Siilasvuo in Jerusalem for 30 minutes the Israeli national radio said and after the meeting the U.N. officer said: ‘‘There were no misunderstandings today.” Prime Minister Golda Meir went before the Knesset (parliament) in Jerusalem to discuss the cease-fire and the well-informed newspaper Ma’aariv said she would say that Israel cannot move toward peace talks so long as the cease-fire agreement is not honored. Israel contends that to give up control of the Cairo-Suez road would enable Egypt to resupply its trapped 3rd Army with both men and war materiel and cut in two the Israeli force now holding 625 square miles of Egypt. It threatened to cut off all supplies to the 3rd Army if the cease-fire agreements are not kept. The major flareup occurred Monday when Finnish U.N. forces set up their own roadblock just outside Suez City and Israeli troops dismantled it. There were heated words and fistfights but no shooting although both sides were armed and angry. Egyptian officials accused Israel of plunging the cease-fire accords into crisis and one officer said in Cairo “This is now an issue between Israel on the one hand and the Security Council and the United States on the other.” The semiofficial Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram said if Israel continued to block implementation of the agreement its military representatives signed with the Egyptians Sunday Egypt might have to refer the matter to U.N. Secretary Kurt Waldheim. The prisoner of war issue was still at the heart of the matter. Israel has agreed to resupply of food and water to the Egyptian 3rd Army but demands a POW release simultaneously with turning over checkpoints on the Suez-Cairo highway to the U.N. forces. So far there has been no prisoner release. Israel also has been displeased with failure of the six-point agreement worked out by Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger to provide for reopening of the Egyptian blockade of the Strait of Bab El Mandeb leading to the Red Sea. Israeli sources said Israel would test the blockade by running ships through the strait but for security reasons did not say when. |
