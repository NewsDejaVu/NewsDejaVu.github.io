| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under delusions that she was poisoning him, a teenage Damian McElrath stabbed his mother, Diane, to death in 2012. He washed up, called 911 and told the dispatcher what he had done and why he was right to have done it. Keeping up with politics is easy with The 5-Minute Fix Newsletter, in your inbox weekdays. ArrowRight A few years later, when the state of Georgia prosecuted him, a jury found that McElrath was insane at the time — and also, not insane.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jury found him “not guilty by reason of insanity” on the charge of “malice murder,” meaning that he lacked the capacity to distinguish right from wrong or that his delusions meant he lacked criminal intent. But on charges of felony murder and aggravated assault, the jury found him “guilty but mentally ill.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Georgia Supreme Court reviewed the case, it said the conflicting verdicts were so illogical as to be “repugnant” and told prosecutors they could try McElrath again on all three charges.

It also ruled that defendants be given access to government wiretaps before any retrial to determine if government evidence was ‘“‘tainted.’’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. Attorney James R. Thompson said he was “‘very deeply disappointed’’ by the decision. ‘‘To lose it is a very sad thing,”’ he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said he would consult with Klein- dienst before any decision is reached on retrial.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its ruling Tuesday, the appeals court said, ‘‘We conclude that the demeanor of the judge and the prosecutors would require reversal, if other errors did not.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court found there was ‘‘reversible error’’ by Hoffman in selection of the trial jury. The court said Hoffman favored the prosecution during the trial and held a ‘“deprecatory and often antogonistic at- titude toward the defense.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoffman presided over the nearly five- month-long trial— one of the most tur- bulent in the history of American juris- prudence—on charges stemming from disorders at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court’s opinion overturned the convictions of David Dellinger, Rennie C. Davis, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and Thomas Hayden. Two other defendants, John Froines and Lee Weiner, were acquitted of all criminal charges brought by the government.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ‘Chicago Seven” originally were eight. Black Panther leader Bobby G. Seale, who at one point in the trial was gagged and tied to a chair to keep order in the courtroom, was severed from the trial in its early stages.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendants had been charged with conspiring to incite riots at the Democratic convention, but the jury threw out the conspiracy charges and found five defendants guilty of individually crossing<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state lines to incite riots. The five were sentenced to five years in prison and fined $5,000.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the trial, Hoffman cited the seven defendants and their attorneys, William M. Kunstler and Leonard I. Wein- glass, for contempt of court and sentenced them to terms ranging from two months and 18 days for Weiner to four years and 13 days for Kunstler.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last May, the appeals court overturned the contempt citations, saying those sentenced to more than six months for contempt should have jury trials before another judge. However, the government has indicated it would seek sentences of less than six months—177 days—and a jury trial would be unnecessary.  |
