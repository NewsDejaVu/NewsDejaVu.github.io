| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Astronomers have discovered a rare in-sync solar system with six planets moving like a grand cosmic orchestra, untouched by outside forces since their birth billions of years ago.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The find, announced Wednesday, can help explain how solar systems across the Milky Way galaxy came to be. This one is 100 light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of planet-hunting satellites — NASA’s Tess and the European Space Agency’s Cheops — teamed up for the observations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the planets in perfect synchrony are within the star’s so-called habitable zone, which means little if any likelihood of life, at least as we know it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Here we have a golden target” for comparison, said Adrien Leleu of the University of Geneva, who was part of an international team that published the results in the journal Nature.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This star, known as HD 110067, may have even more planets. The six found so far are roughly two to three times  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/six-planets-solar-system-nasa-esa-3d67e5a1ba7cbea101d756fc6e47f33d](https://apnews.com/article/six-planets-solar-system-nasa-esa-3d67e5a1ba7cbea101d756fc6e47f33d) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LAGSTAFF, Ariz., March 13. —In that Httle cluster of orba which scampers across the sidereal abyss under the name of solar system there are nine instead of a mere elght worlds, The presence of a ninth marcher in the retinue of the sun, long suspected, was an- nounced here today by Dr. V.
