Doctors have recommended the young mother of four undergo the abortion be- cause of the possibility her child has been deformed by a drug, thalidomide, which she took in the early stages of her pregnancy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drug has been blamed for thousands of malformed babies born in Europe and other coun- tries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finkbine said after a confer- ence with her attorneys and doc- tors they would “seek help in a more favorable legal climate.” He refused to say where that might be.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Finkbine’s chances for an abortion without risk of prosecu- tion might be best in Japan, Den- mark, or the Soviet Union.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other states in the United States have laws similar to Ari- zona. A ruling by a court or state attorney general would be neces- sary to authorize the operation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Japan, about 1,000 for- eign women have abortions year- ly. There are no legal restrictions, the operations are generally per- formed under linical conditions and the price is about $50,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denmark also offers legal! abor- tion, for medical or social rea-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sons, Keeps Price High<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russia keeps the price of abor- tion high to discourage the prac- tice, but there are no legal re- Strictions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A judge Monday dismissed a suit which was intended to in- sure Mrs, Finkbine—a 30-year-old local television personality — and the hospital freedom from crim- inal prosecution under Arizona law.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve Morris. superintendent of Good Samaritan Hospital, said he gathered from Finkbine’s com- ments the couple would lose no more time in arranging for the abortion, Doctors who recom- mended the abortion said it should be performed within two weeks, at the three months stage of her pregnancy, or a caesarean section would be required.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Finkbine told her husband earlier she “couldn't go on living if she had to wake up every morning thinking of having a baby without arms or legs.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dismissing the action, Judge Yale McFate said the court has no jurisdiction to give advice and interpret the law for the Fink- bines and the Good Samaritan Hospital, co-plaintiffs in the suit. He said there are no true defend- ants and the court could not de- cide whether it is morally right or wrong for Mrs. Finkbine to terminate her pregnancy,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finkbine, a high school teach- er, said late Monday they would consult their lawyers and doctors and try to reevaluate the situa- tion,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But we have no plans yet,” he said, adding that his wife was “just fine. She is disappointed, but has her chin up.”  |
