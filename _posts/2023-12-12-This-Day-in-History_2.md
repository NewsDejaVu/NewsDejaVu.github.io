| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DENVER (AP) — Just weeks before the deadline for Colorado to reintroduce gray wolves under a voter-approved initiative, representatives of the cattle industry association are suing state and federal agencies in the hopes of delaying the predators’ release.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gunnison County Stockgrowers’ Association and Colorado Cattlemen’s Association say in the lawsuit filed Monday that U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services failed to adequately review the effects of reintroducing up to 50 wolves over the next several years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carnivores’ planned release in Colorado, voted for in a 2020 ballot measure, has already stirred controversy and sharpened divides between rural and urban residents. City dwellers largely voted to reintroduce the apex predators into the rural areas where prey can include livestock that help drive local economies.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erin Karney, executive vice-president of the Colorado Cattlemen’s Association, said they will also be requesting a temporary restraining order to halt the impending re ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/wolf-reintroduction-colorado-lawsuit-environment-80dd1eeac13b5f6395c4c007a96df7aa](https://apnews.com/article/wolf-reintroduction-colorado-lawsuit-environment-80dd1eeac13b5f6395c4c007a96df7aa) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ST. LOUIS, Mo, (AP) — For more than three years, the neighbors have been talking about George Wilson's boarders. Some have threatened to kill them,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Wilson says it’s just a mis- understanding.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boarders are his pet six grey timber wolves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The animals only get angry when they see guns and ammu- nition, which they’ve learned to associate with death.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After one of the wolves bit a 9 year-old girl recently, the wound requiring several stitch- es, neighbors got 30 signatures on a petition demanding that Wilson get rid of the wolves. The board of trustees of subur. ban Calverton Park, where Wil son lives, ordered him to dis pose of his pets.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“At first, I considered having the animals destroyed,’ Wilso:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said, “but interested persons advised me against it because of the wolves’ great value as research tools to behavioral scientists studying the relation- ship between animals and hu- mans.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board granted him until Monday to find another suitable owner. He has visited several zoos to determine where his wolves would have the best _ home.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilson says the biting incident was the first involving his wolves, and the same could have occurred with a dog.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He keeps the wolves in a one: half acre yard with a nine-foo! fence around it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilson said a naturalist gave jhim his first wolf and he go others from veterinarians. Wil   son, a custom furniture maker   and his wife, Ruth, have helpec -;} the animals give birth and hav: i bottle fed the young, he said  |
