| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed a local Texas election to go forward under a map that a lower court had found diluted the votes of Black and Latino residents. The order came in response to a challenge from civil rights advocates opposed to the voting districts in Galveston County. While the case involves the boundaries in just one locality, it could have broader implications for challenges to election maps and the protection of voting rights nationwide.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is customary with emergency applications, the Supreme Court majority did not explain its rationale for leaving the map in place for now. That means it is unclear whether the majority thought it was too close to the election campaigns to get involved, or if some justices are sympathetic to the argument that “majority-minority” districts are not covered by the Voting Rights Act.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court’s three liberal justices dissented from the decision not to stay an order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.
