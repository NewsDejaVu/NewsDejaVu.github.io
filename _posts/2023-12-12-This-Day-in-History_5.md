| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Washington Nationals signed right-handed reliever Dylan Floro to a one-year deal Tuesday evening, adding an experienced arm to their bullpen. Floro, an eight-year veteran who turns 33 later this month, split time with the Miami Marlins and the Minnesota Twins in 2023 and has a career 3.42 ERA and 32 saves in 330 games. He struggled this year, posting a 4.76 ERA — the highest of his career for a full season.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract — for $2.25 million plus performance incentives, according to a person familiar with the terms — represents a low-stakes gamble that Floro will regain the form he had from 2018 to 2022, when he was an effective piece of bullpens for the Dodgers, Reds and Marlins.

He went with the Giants in 1958 and then came back to New!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘York last year when he wa:   traded to the Mets.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mays came into the ‘league, only one of today’s 1: ‘home parks-—-Wrigley Field i ‘Chicago—was in operation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dashing exploits in the field, his explosive bat and hi: ‘daring baseball captivates baseball fans for two decades, ““Everybody knows why I'rr phere, I'm retiring after this season, I only hope I can make some  contribuution toward: another championship in New _York in the little time left.’ But Mays revealed that he suffered three broken ribs it _ Montreal on Sept. 9 and “‘I'n not going to go out there on the ‘field if I'm not 100 per cent . The team still has a chance t 'win, and I dont want t Sinterfere with that.” it} Mays said he wasnt bur<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what exact position he'll! hold in the Met organization siarting next year.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“T have many directions to go and many things to consider. But one thing I know, the game is my life. It's just a question of what the club will want me<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to do. We'll settle that when the: season's over and   sit down with Mr, Donald Grant. He knows I love to be around kids, and I'm sure that’s one area I'll work in.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed in a checked sports coat with green pants, Mays spoke to a formal — press conference before nine TV cameras.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s difficult to explain how much I love baseball. We have what you'd call a love affair.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mays was one of the most electrifying and exciting play ers ever to play the game since Alexancer Cartwright first set the hases 90 feet apart a century or 80 ago,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his skills have been tarnished by age and injury and he is hitting only .211 this ‘season in 66 games. He has ‘been hobbled with swollen<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knees, an inflamed shoulder and bruised ribs this year,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mays has no worry about his security, He's been making $165,000 a year as a player and under the terms of his contract, he'll still receive $50,000 a year until age 50 even though he’s not playing,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mays now has 660 homers in his career, including six this season, and only Babe Ruth and Henry Aaron are ahead of him. If Mays hadn't lost almost two full seasons in the majors, he probably would have chal lenged Ruth's career record of 714 homers, Mays was the NL homer champion three times.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mays was first signed to a New York Giants contract in 1950 at age 19. The following year, he was brought up to the majors on June 24 after hitting 477 in 35 games at Min-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neapolis.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The centerfielder helped the Giants pull off their miracle finish in 1951 but after playing 34 games in 1952, he was drafted into the Army. The Korean War was then being fought.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mays finished his two-year hitch in 1954 and promptly won the MVIF award that year and led the Giants to the World Series triumph over the Cleve- land Indians.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His over-the-shoulder  exteh on Vie Wertz’ drive in the first game of that series was cae of the most memorable moments in World Series history and helped establish himself as a national folk hero,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mays went to San Francisco whe the Giants moved there tn, 1958 but the reception he received never quite ma ‘hed the one he received in New (York.  |
