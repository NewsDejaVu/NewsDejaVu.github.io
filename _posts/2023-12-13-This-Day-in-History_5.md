| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIY iMessage-on-Android workarounds are nothing new, but the movement got a boost last month — U.K. phone maker Nothing and a start-up called Sunbird released an app that let owners of a niche Android phone easily send and receive iMessages.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party didn’t last long, though: After launching a beta version of the Nothing Chats app in late November, the app was withdrawn from the Google Play Store because of concerns over how the service handled user data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast-forward to last Tuesday, when a company called Beeper launched its own app — Beeper Mini — to bring iMessage to Android. The twist? Anyone with an Android phone could use it. All you had to do was download it from the Google Play Store, something Beeper says happened more than 100,000 times.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was by many accounts a more elegant, more responsible way to send iMessages from an Android device. You didn’t even need to fork over your Apple ID — iMessages sent from Beeper Mini originated from your phone number, so recipients woul ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/12/imessage-android-beeper/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/12/imessage-android-beeper/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHIPPANY, N.J. (AP)—Today in some homes in Morris, IIl., mom can dial on the telephone, hang up, and ring every extension phone in the house to call the family to dinner.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tonight, if she and dad are going visiting, they can dial a simple series of numbers, and from that moment on every call coming to their home phone will be routed to the house they will ‘Visit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just two of the won- ders of a telephone system of the future, installed today for trial in 50 homes and offices in Morris by the Bell Telephone System.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1965, Bell Laboratories offi- cials expect to have the system in production for national use. Eventually 600 Morris users will give this vanguard system its cus-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tomer trial. Other services to be added at Morris, or eventually to the national system:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third party, and perhaps oth- ers, will be able to dial into an existing telephone conversation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of special interest in homes where teen-agers monopolize the telephone, the system will hold incoming calls with a recorded “please _ wait’ announcement, ringing the busy phone as soon as it is hung up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bell officials say the new sys- tem can handle any new service that can be logically described.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these wonders are han- dled by a new, super-quick cen- tral office that replaces mechanical devices with thou- sands of transistors and neon- filled tubes, and a photographic electronic memory.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new central office makes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its moves in a matter of micro- seconds, or millionths of a sec- ond. There are as many millionths of a second in one minute as there are minutes in about 107 years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of the new system<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the photographic memory. Its actions are to a large extent set up ahead of time by the instruc- tions in this memory, or book of procedures. _ An electronic eye scans the coded instructions on glass photo- graphic plates, learning from ‘these clusters of photographic dots what actions to perform next to complete the call.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the numbers you dial refer to some specific instruction in the photographic memory, the ma- chine looks up the instruction and handles your call as it was in- structed to do,  |
