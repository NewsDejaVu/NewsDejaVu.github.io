| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOHELA’s haphazard handling of the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which encourages college graduates to enter fields serving the public good with the promise of having their student debt canceled after a certain period. People have complained of inaccurate payment counts, inconsistent information, long wait times and processing delays, problems they say undermine the program.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSLF program was created by Congress in 2007, and requires borrowers to make 120 on-time monthly payments for 10 years to have their remaining balance canceled.
