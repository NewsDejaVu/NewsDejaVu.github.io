| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European Union officials reached a landmark deal Friday on the world’s most ambitious law to regulate artificial intelligence, paving the way for what could become a global standard to classify risk, enforce transparency and financially penalize tech companies for noncompliance. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight At a time when the sharpest critics of AI are warning of its nearly limitless threat, even as advocates herald its benefits to humanity’s future, Europe’s AI Act seeks to ensure that the technology’s exponential advances are accompanied by monitoring and oversight, and that its highest-risk uses are banned. Tech companies that want to do business in the 27-nation bloc of 450 million consumers — the West’s single largest — would be compelled to disclose data and do rigorous testing, particularly for “high-risk” applications in products like self-driving cars and medical equipment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragos Tudorache, a Romanian lawmaker co-leading ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/08/ai-act-regulation-eu/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/08/ai-act-regulation-eu/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON — AP — President Ford has signed a sweeping trade reform bill and expressed both hope and fear about its impact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill gives Ford authority to reduce tariff and other trade barriers for a new round of trade negotiations this year.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In signing the bill at a White House ceremony Friday, Ford described it as “the most significant trade legislation passed by the Congress since the beginning of the trade agreement program four decades ago.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Ford took sharp issue with amendments pegging Soviet trade concessions to freer emigration of Soviet Jews and with restrictions on trade concessions to mem- bers of the Organization of Petroleum (Exporting Countries (OPEC).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I must express my reservations about’ the wisdom of legislative language that can only be seen as objectionable and discriminatory by other sovereign nations,’’ Ford said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford apparently was<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; responding not only to Soviet criticism of the bill but also to bitter attacks by Venezuela and Ecuador, both OPEC members.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford also signed a bill to allow broadcast and newspaper reporting of state lottery results. Congress passed the measure after Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe warned that many state-run lotteries violated federal law prohibiting public reporting of lottery information.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President vetoed legislation that would have allowed retail milk prices to go up by six cents a_half- gallon, calling the bill ‘‘highly inflationary to consumers and unnecessary.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade bill establishes a long-promised system of generalized tariff preferences for the manufactured products of developing nations but denies participation by OPEC countries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Congress ignored a State Department recom- mendation that Venezuela and Ecuador be exempted from the OPEC restriction on the ground that, unlike their Arab counterparts, these countries never have used oil as a political weapon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Soviet Union has rejected the bill’s linkage of trade benefits to Russian emigration policy, calling the provision interference in its internal affairs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. officials said after the bill-signing ceremony that they expected discussions between Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and Soviet officials before any move by Ford to proclaim the Soviet Union eligible for most favored nation trade benefits.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford had said he needed the bill to help avert  in- ternational economic disasters as oil prices rise and food supplies dwindle.  |
