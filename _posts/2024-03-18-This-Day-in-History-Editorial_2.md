| The Government Big Tech And Free Speech Round Two | A Security Blanket Frays At The Edges |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court is back on the First Amendment beat Monday when it hears cases asking whether government officials can jawbone businesses to restrict speech. It seems government needs remedial constitutional training. In Murthy v. Missouri states and individuals whose posts on Covid were censored sued federal officials for violating the First Amendment. Lower courts ruled for the plaintiffs based on copious evidence that government officials pressured social-media platforms to suppress their ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-government-big-tech-and-free-speech-round-two-supreme-court-264ff24b?mod=editorials_article_pos1)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting article which appeared some months ago in Psychology magazine suggested that if existing Food and Drug Administration regulations had been in existence then wed still be testing Pasteurization penicillin would be listed as experimental and the Sabin and Salk immunization techniques for prevention of paralysis in polio would be under investigation today. I dont know about that but whenever I hear anyone sing praises to the government for protecting us from vagaries ranging from poverty to smoke inhalation I think of George Washingtons observation that a nation which depends upon government to feed it soon will starve to death. I wonder if that doesnt say something about the general efficiency and effectiveness of government in just about every field of human management. The liberals want desperately to think that there is a god called Government which watches over them performing miracles which never occurred to the Jehovah of the Old Testament or the Jesus of the New. Its a sort of political security blanket I suppose. But it must test the faith of a government-worshipper when this god takes so many called third strikes. Right now there is the great hexachlorophene hoax. The government said hexachlorophene was dangerous around infants and told hospitals to stop using it. But 20 hospitals reported that the incidence of staphlococcus infection in infants increased significantly when they quit using hexachlorophene. So now theyre having to take another look. How can that be? Didnt the government already make the infallible decision? The point of course is that private industry and private individuals are faulty and imperfect vessels and government is made up of private individuals who carry into their official work all the faults and imperfections of the people who work for private industry or for themselves in bicycle shops or laboratories. The difference is that an official mistake becomes law and if the error is a lethal one then good citizenship requires us to lay down our lives for it. We do have to obey the law dont we? And then there is the matter of the poisoned tuna fish. The magazine National Review recalls it like this: Charlie the Tuna the one with good taste came in for all sorts of flak last January and February as the ecologists found the succulent fish just festering with mercury. Eventually the guardians of our tummies decided after bankrupting part of the tuna industry and shutting down several mercury-using factories that we could probably eat tuna and live. But now comes the news in two-inch fillers at the bottoms of back pages of some journals short of news of war and rapine that Mercury in 1909 tuna as high as in todays. Not everybody saves old tuna but the Smithsonian Institution has some going back to 1878 as well as some from 1909 and sure enough the mercury range is 0.5 to 15 parts mercury per million identical to that caught yesterday in California waters. Which means either that granddad should have been a thermometer or else that maybe we can have a tuna-salad sandwich and survive till cocktail hour. What ever happened to cyclamates? |

| Why Are Lawmakers Trying To Ban Tiktok Instead Of Doing What Voters Actually Want? | Non-Political Differences |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America is politically polarized. But there is an issue on which both sides agree: We need more privacy and TikTok should not be banned. A record 72 percent of Americans want “more government regulation” of what companies can do with their data according to an October report from Pew Research Center. And only 31 percent of Americans favor a nationwide ban on TikTok according to a February Associated Press/NORC opinion poll. Despite public sentiment the U.S. House passed legislation on Wednesday. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/opinion/tiktok-ban-house-vote.html?searchResultPosition=2)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep business healthy and the good things in life will trickle down to the masses. Keep the working man working and reasonably well paid and his health and stability will filter up through the entire economic structure. You can hear as many opposing political philosophies as you care to listen to. In todays America the differences between Republicans and Democrats arent easy to define. There are for example liberal Republicans and there are conservative Democrats — but these are defined within their respective parties. That is to say a conservative Democrat in the eyes of another Democrat actually may act like a flaming liberal in the opinion of a Republican. And so it goes. Ultimately many of us decide the political opinions arent nearly so important as the quality of the people who hold them. Then we succumb to what we think is the wisdom of ‘voting for the man.’ This runs contrary to our system of checks and balances in government because it weakens the differences that supposedly keep us in balance. We vote for the man and lament the loss of a strong two-party system. Result: frustration. So it was with considerable comfort that we read the Republican Congressional Committee’s recent newsletter that set the issue straight. Here’s how according to the newsletter you can tell Democrats from Republicans: ‘Democrats buy most of the books that have been banned somewhere. Republicans form censorship committees and read them as a group. ‘Republicans consume three-fourths of all the rutabaga produced in this country. The remainder is thrown out. ‘Republicans usually wear hats and almost always clean their paint brushes. “Republicans employ exterminators. Democrats step on the bugs. ‘Democrats eat the fish they catch. Republicans hang them on the wall. — ‘Republican boys date Democratic girls. They plan to marry Republican girls but feel they’re entitled to a little fun first. ‘Republicans sleep in twin beds — some even in separate rooms. That is why there are more Democrats.” The newsletter pointed out the differences are not original with it. Which leads us to a final difference: Republicans borrow their ideas from Democrats; Democrats come up with the ideas then blame the results on the Republicans. |
