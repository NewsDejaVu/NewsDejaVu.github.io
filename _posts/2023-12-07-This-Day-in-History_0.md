| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — A federal lawsuit filed by a group of states alleges the NCAA’s transfer rule for college athletes violates antitrust law.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawsuit, filed in West Virginia’s northern district, challenges the NCAA’s authority to impose a one-year delay in the eligibility of certain athletes who transfer between schools. The suit said the rule “unjustifiably restrains the ability of these college athletes to engage in the market for their labor as NCAA Division I college athletes.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawsuit filed by West Virginia and six other states alleges violations of the Sherman Act.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCAA rules allow underclassmen to transfer once without having to sit out a year. But an additional transfer as an undergraduate generally requires the NCAA to grant a waiver allowing the athlete to compete immediately. Without it, the athlete would have to sit out for a year at the new school.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCAA has implemented stricter guidelines for granting those waivers on a case-by-case basis.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an inte ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/ncaa-transfer-rule-lawsuit-west-virginia-945c1c2c365eeef9d0148915a7445f6c](https://apnews.com/article/ncaa-transfer-rule-lawsuit-west-virginia-945c1c2c365eeef9d0148915a7445f6c) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tig gs peed eb svi 25   sree tet wd Jo). 325 l ees!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Des Moines, March 17—#?— Dean C. C. Williams, chairman of the University of Iowa athletic board, told the legislative commit- tee today that every effort was made to obtain reinstatement by the Big 10 conference of 14 ath- letes who had been disqualified for borrowing money from the so- called “Belting Fund,”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean Williams, on cross exam- ination, said the board presented to the conference in May, 1930, a petition asking that eight of the athletes still in competition be declared eligible. In addition, he said, he visited the universities of Illinois and Chicago to discuss the case with officials.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brief submitted to the con- ference on the case was read into the records in an effort to show that the athletes thought they were borrowing directly from the bank instead of athletic funds. Nevertheless the conference turned down the request unanimously.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special conference commit- tee which came to Iowa City in January 1930 refused to interview the disqualifies athletes, Dean Williams. testified.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oran Pape of Dubuque, for- mer football and track star, said that E. H. Lauer, athletic director, once signed a note with him for $300 after he had been unable tq obtain the money from other sources, He told attorney Emmet Tinley, representing the board of edu- cation, that he believed Lauer acted from friendship but later declared to attorney Dennis Kelleher that he thought the motive was to keep him in school.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Des Moines, March 17---7P— Only a few gaps remain in the history of the University of Iowa’s athletic woes being written into the records of the legislative com- mittee investigating the school’s administration.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E, H. Lauer, athletic director, two or three members of the athletic board, and Oran Pape of Dubuque, former football lumin- ary, remained to testify, on the subject when the twentieth day of the probe openec this morning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee hopes to com- plete the athletic phase of the in- vestigation within a few days, it is understood, after which a study of university finances and business methods will be resumed. <A pos- sibility was expressed that the legislators would go to Iowa City next week for further inquiries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams Testifies<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean C. C. Williams, chairman of the athletic board, was telling the story of the disqualification of 14 athletes when Monday’s session adjourned. The action was the only one by which Iowa could re- turn to the Big Ten, he declared, and was adopted reluctantly be- cause of a belief the athletes themselves were innocent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The athletic council first voiced “that opinion, he pointed out, in a resolution adopted in October, 1929, refusing to disquality them for borrowing money unknowing- ly from the so-called Belting fund.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then ‘he conference’ turned Iowa’s plea for reinstatement, he recalled, with the assertion that only by declaring the athletes ineligible could the school resume athletic relations. The board agreed, Dean Williams continued, but sought to have the conference reverse the action.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special committee came to Iowa City to investigate the situa- tion, he said, but appeared more interested in reports of a new slush fund than in reinstatement of the athletes. The committee felt it unnecessary to interview the boys, he testified, even though Lauer had arranged for a meeting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean Williams maintained that Reed Lane and Charles Sessions,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apcremeranentnenan eencesnmitgmeete<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LS ftamtbinarsecrn A am Wace 2  |
