| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Astronomers have discovered a rare in-sync solar system with six planets moving like a grand cosmic orchestra, untouched by outside forces since their birth billions of years ago.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The find, announced Wednesday, can help explain how solar systems across the Milky Way galaxy came to be. This one is 100 light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of planet-hunting satellites — NASA’s Tess and the European Space Agency’s Cheops — teamed up for the observations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the planets in perfect synchrony are within the star’s so-called habitable zone, which means little if any likelihood of life, at least as we know it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Here we have a golden target” for comparison, said Adrien Leleu of the University of Geneva, who was part of an international team that published the results in the journal Nature.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This star, known as HD 110067, may have even more planets. The six found so far are roughly two to three times  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/six-planets-solar-system-nasa-esa-3d67e5a1ba7cbea101d756fc6e47f33d](https://apnews.com/article/six-planets-solar-system-nasa-esa-3d67e5a1ba7cbea101d756fc6e47f33d) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) — ‘Intolerable errors’ in the pre- dicted timetable of Halley's Comet have led a University of California scientific team to be- lieve a 10th planet may be circling the sun beyond Pluto outermost known planet in the solar system,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three computer scientists at the University’s Lawrence Liv- exmore Laboratory said Friday their prediction of the planet's existence is based on mathema- tical calculations related to the orbit of the mysterious Comet,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team, led by Joseph L. Brady, named the proposed body ‘Planet X."’ According to the scientists, the planet would be 300 times more massive<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than earth and about six billion miles from the sun—far beyond the orbit of Pluto. The earth is 93 million miles from the sun.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planet would take 512 years to make a single revolu- tion around the sun, and its or- bit would be sharply tilted from the plane in which the other nine planets revolve, the scien- tists said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brady said he came up with the ‘‘Planet X’"’ theory after studying unexplained orbital deviations of Halley's Comet. He said he concluded the devia- tions could be caused by the gravitational action of ‘Planet ge<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientist said past pre- dictions of the arrival of Hal-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ley’s Comet near earth have re- peatedly been wrong by several days.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Errors like those are intol- erable and they demanded an explanation,”’ Brady said, “They couldn't be satisfactorily explained by the turmoil in the gases of the comet's tail as it approached the sun, but they fit precisely into a gravitational picture of the solar system that included a tenth planet.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings of the team will be published in Monday's edi- tion of the Journal of the As- tronomical Society of the Pacif- ie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brady said the prediction of new planets based on math- ematical calculations was not<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new. He said Neptune’s location was predicted in a similar way in 1846, as was Pluto's in this century.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added he hoped his pre- diction would encourage as- tronomers with powerful tele- scopes to look for the planet, but he admitted the hunt would be like searching for a needle in a haystack.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The proposed planet is lo- cated in the densely populated Milky Way where even a tiny area encompasses thousands of stars, many of which = are brighter than we expect this planet to be,” Brady said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. “Tf it exists, it will be ex- tremely difficult to find.”  |
