| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — With Planet Earth running a fever, U.N. climate talks focused Sunday on the contagious effects on human health.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a brown haze over Dubai, the COP28 summit moved past two days of lofty rhetoric and calls for unity from top leaders to concerns about health issues like the deaths of at least 7 million people globally from air pollution each year and the spread of diseases like cholera and malaria as global warming upends weather systems.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it’s high time for the U.N. Conference of Parties on climate to hold its first “Health Day” in its 28th edition, saying the threats to health from climate change were “immediate and present.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Although the climate crisis is a health crisis, it’s well overdue that 27 COPs have been and gone without a serious discussion of health,” he said. “Undoubtedly, health stands as the most compelling reason for taking climate action.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/climate-health-ab2a64170501124239db9efaf11d3f77](https://apnews.com/article/climate-health-ab2a64170501124239db9efaf11d3f77) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOSCOW (AP) — President Nixon’s summit conference with Soviet leaders produced its first modest results today—an agreement to sign blueprints for joint action against dread diseases and to counter pollu- tion of the environment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signing was to take place following an afternoon session between Nixon and Communist party chief Leonid I. Brezhnev.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two delegations met for nearly two hours this morning in the first formal session of the Soviet-American summit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the initial agreements, it was learned, would aim at joint American-Soviet health re- search, with emphasis on com- bating such major killers as cancer and heart trouble.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second would provide for collaboration in helping to clean up the global environ- ment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moments after a faraway chime sounded the hour of 11 a.m. Nixon and Brezhnev led their delegations into the ornate Catherine Hall in the Grand Kremlin Palace from opposite sides of the big room. After ex- changing hand clasps, small talk and smiles, they sat down facing each other across the conference table.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nixon was flanked by Secre- tary of State William P. Rogers and Henry A. Kissinger, the President’s assistant for nation- al secuirty affairs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting on either side of Brezhnev were President Ni- kolai Podgorny and Premier Alexei N. Kosygin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before serious business be- gan, Podgorny offered Nixon a package of Ukrainian cigaretts. commenting, ““‘They ."e no bad.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nixon, who smokes an occa- sional cigar, fingered the pack politely, then placed it back on the table.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nixon and Brezhnev held an unscheduled exploratory confer- ence Monday shortly after the President’s arrival in Moscow. They met for nearly two hours -in Brezhnev’'s Kremlin office for a ‘businesslike and frank”’ preliminary discussion of inter-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; national problems and U:S.-So- viet relations, White House press secretary Ronald L. Zieg- ler reported.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President and Mrs. Nix- on were entertained on their first night in Moscow at an offi- cial Kremlin dinner in the eve- ning at which Nixon and Soviet President Nikolai V. Podgorny both talked of cooperating to restrain the arms race, pro- mote world peace and seek friendlier relations between their two countries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nixon and Podgorny also made veiled references to the Vietnam War without breaking any new ground. But Podgor- ny’s failure to mention Nixon’s order for the mining of North Vietnamese ports seemed to suggest that the war would cause no public pyrotechnics during the visit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nixon, who said before his arrival that he believed the two governments were approaching the talks in a cooperative fash- ion, told the dinner guests:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See SUMMIT Page 6  |
