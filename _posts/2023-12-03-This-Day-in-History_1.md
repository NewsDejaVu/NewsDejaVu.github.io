| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — With Planet Earth running a fever, U.N. climate talks focused Sunday on the contagious effects on human health.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a brown haze over Dubai, the COP28 summit moved past two days of lofty rhetoric and calls for unity from top leaders to concerns about health issues like the deaths of at least 7 million people globally from air pollution each year and the spread of diseases like cholera and malaria as global warming upends weather systems.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it’s high time for the U.N. Conference of Parties on climate to hold its first “Health Day” in its 28th edition, saying the threats to health from climate change were “immediate and present.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Although the climate crisis is a health crisis, it’s well overdue that 27 COPs have been and gone without a serious discussion of health,” he said. “Undoubtedly, health stands as the most compelling reason for taking climate action.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/climate-health-ab2a64170501124239db9efaf11d3f77](https://apnews.com/article/climate-health-ab2a64170501124239db9efaf11d3f77) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OTTAWA (AP) — President Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney are showing little sign they’ll reach quick agreements on trade, environmental and defense issues while renewing ties at their third annual summit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We like each other,’’ Reagan beamed Sunday when asked the significance of the meeting, scheduled to keep Reagan in the Canadian capital for a little over 24 hours.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issues, however:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Reagan warned that it will take ‘‘much hard bargaining” to reach a free trade agreement between the two countries, and that ‘“‘setting the goals is ... easier than achieving them. ”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—The president’s spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the administration has nothing new to offer on the acid rain issue.in response to Mulroney’s proposal that the two ‘countries try hammering out a treaty to reduce airborne emissions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Mulroney said Canada will stand by its insistence on sovereignty over the Northwest Passage, declaring, “We own it, lock; stock and icebergs.”’ The United States ‘seeks the right of transit for its warships through the passage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spokesmen for both sides said no substantial agreements were expected.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Reagan and Mulroney met for 35 minutes Sunday, longer than had been expected, in front of a crackling fire in the drawing room of Rideau Hall, the residence of Canadian Governor General Jeanne Sauve.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reagan was to meet today with John Turner, leader of Mulroney’s parliamentary opposition, and then resume his meetings with the prime minister before delivering a speech to Parliament and flying back to Washington.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atastate dinner Sunday night, Reagan said free trade talks initiated by Mulroney have ‘‘opened a historic<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ospect.””<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Setting the goals is, however, easier than achieving them. Our intense negotiations to bring a comprehensive free trade agreement into being certainly suggests this. There is still much hard bargaining ahead.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one issue, however, the two leaders agreed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They agreed to joint work in the fight against AIDS,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which would be worked out jointly by the secretary of health and human services in the United States and the minister of national health and welfare here in Canada," Fitzwater said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also agreed to put the fight against the deadly disease on tje agenda of the June economic summit meeting in Venice, he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arrival Sunday at Uplands Canadian Forces Base, Reagan drove to the governor general’s house past knots of onlookers and a few protesers holding up signs such as ‘‘No Free Trade in Acid Rain’ and “Canada Is Not for Sale.’’ One group hoisted a sup- portive banner reading, ‘‘Friends in Freedom.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier Sunday on the NBC television program ‘‘Meet the Press,’ Mulroney was asked about Reagan’s commitment to spend $2.5 billion for research on ways to combat acid rain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Well, more research can’t do any harm but what is required is a treaty between Canada and the United States to provide for a specified time frame during which shall be reductions in these emissions that are killing our lakes and streams,” he said.  |
