| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Ballistic missiles fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels struck three commercial ships Sunday in the Red Sea, while a U.S. warship shot down three drones in self-defense during the hourslong assault, the U.S. military said. The Iranian-backed Houthis claimed two of the attacks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strikes marked an escalation in a series of maritime attacks in the Mideast linked to the Israel-Hamas war, as multiple vessels found themselves in the crosshairs of a single Houthi assault for the first time in the conflict. The U.S. vowed to “consider all appropriate responses” in the wake of the attack, specifically calling out Iran, after tensions have been high for years now over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“These attacks represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security,” the U.S. military’s Central Command said in a statement. “They have jeopardized the lives of international crews representing multiple countries around the world.”  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-houthi-yemen-ships-attack-israel-hamas-war-gaza-strip-716770f0a780160e9abed98d3c48fbde](https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-houthi-yemen-ships-attack-israel-hamas-war-gaza-strip-716770f0a780160e9abed98d3c48fbde) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By CHARLES BERNARD HONOLULU (UPI) — Top military aides at this Pacific command post today were studying the implications of the attack by three North Vietnamese torpedo boats on the destroyer USS Maddox to determine if the action meant a shift in Communist policy in Southeast Asia,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military and diplomatic sources here and in Washington made it clear, however, that the United States would continue to meet such attacks with the swift retaliation dealt the Communist torpedo boats Sunday,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U. S. Pacific Commander Adm. Ulysses Grant Sharp Jr. called the attack on the Madox ‘‘unprovoked’ in a statement released from his headquarters here, And he warned that ‘if somebody shoots at us we will shoot back at them,” ,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Damage Sustained The Maddox sustained no damage or casualties in the attack which occurred in international waters, about 35 miles off the coast of North Viet Nam, One of the boats launched three torpedoes at the destroyer and then opened fire with its 37 millimeter guns, The Maddox returned the fire with its five-inch guns and four Navy jet fighters from the aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga set down a blanket of machine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gun and rocket fire, One of the Communist boats was stopped dead in the water and the other two limped away damaged, but it was not known if they suffered casualties,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp was asked before entering a conference withhis top aides if the attack might reflect a possible change in Communist tactics,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If they are so bold as to shoot at us, it is a change,'’ Sharp replied,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checking Charges Sharp and his aides also were trying to determine if the attack had any connection with a charge made by North Viet Nam Sunday that four U.S, fighter-bombers from Laos had fired bombs and rockets into a North Vietnamese border village, wounding one person and destroying many homes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pacific commander said U.S, naval vessels had operated in the area of the attack many times and that Sunday's incident marked the first time a ship had encountered hostile action.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp made it clear that U.S, ships operating in Southeast Asian waters would not be intimidated by the attack. ;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Our ships will go whereever they need to go in international waters,”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ Sharp said,  |
