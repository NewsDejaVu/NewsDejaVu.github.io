Alicia Keys had just appeared in a sequined red jumpsuit and matching encrusted gown and rather gratuitously flubbed the opening note of her hit piano ballad “If I Ain’t Got You.” She recovered and as she approached the end of the chorus you could hear Usher singing in quiet harmony as the camera panned back se ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/11/arts/music/usher-super-bowl-halftime-review.html)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank Sinatra the pale frail-fig- ured fellow with the swoon croon doesn’t even have to sing to wow a crowd.

He’s completely un- perturbed by this first crooner book- ing in that musically sacred sanc- tum and avers he has no long- haired vocal ambitions In fact he imported to reporters he doesnt read music and his Saturday en- gagement was made to help the bowl financially. For an hour before his train ar- rived teen-agers jittered and jived to recorded music issuing from loud peakers thoughtfully installed beforehand But the loudspeakers were no match for the howling din that went up when the train rolled in and Sinatra stuck his head through the vestibule doorway. Tne lean featured and red polka- dot bow tie were all it took to send Sinatras admirers surging forward scratching and snatching at each other for better vantage points from which to view their idol. Somebody even bit a reporter on the arm (the writing arm too). Has His Own Ideas Twenty minutes later police man- aged to slip Sinatra through to a nearby garage for a press confer- ence wherein he declared earnestly that he just sings sincerely for ev- eryone that lyrics are more im- portant than melody and that he likes to think of himself as a story- teller “J pick my songs for the lyrics” he said. “I sing love songs and mean them. They’re meant for .two girls both named. Nancy. One is my wife aged 24. and the other is my 3-year-old. When a music critic remarked that John McCormick also was a story teller in the sense he likewise revered works and enunciation Sin- atra observed: “Well he did all right too.” |

The start of Heidi at 7 pm. EST cut off to most of the country the final minute of the New York Jets-Oakland Raiders game being telecast by NBC from Oakland. And it was no ordinary minute that was cut from the view of football lovers in the Midwest South and East. New York went ahead 32-29 with 1:05 minutes left and the fans at home saw the Raiders return the kickoff and run one play What they didn’t see were two Oakland touchdowns. Julian ‘Goodman president of NBC said in a statement: “It was a forgiveable error committed by human beings who were concerned about the children expecting to see Heidi at 7 p.m. I missed the end of the game as much as anyone else.” The mistake led to such a deluge of telephone calls to NBC headquarters that an operator said the fuses - the switchboard blew out. Many irate fans became further angered when they coulnt get through to NBC to — ps they called police headquarters. This made the New york Police icine unhappy because hundreds of calls were to the emergency police number tying up the most elaborate and modern police emergency call system in the world. Many people also called the New York Telephone company demanding to know why they couldn’t get through to NBC. |
