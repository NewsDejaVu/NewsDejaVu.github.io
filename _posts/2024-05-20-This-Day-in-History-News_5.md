| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DENVER (AP) — Federal appellate court judges expressed doubt Tuesday about whether they could rule on a transgender woman’s admission into a University of Wyoming sorority or if a lower court should continue to hear the case. The admission of Artemis Langford into the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority prompted a lawsuit from six other sorority members last year. After hearing from both sides in the case the three-judge U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals took the arguments under advisement without ruling. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/wyoming-transgender-sorority-lawsuit-kappa-gamma-2d200273c4f3fc18bc56293d3c70e3d1)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DES MOINES Iowa (AP) — A social sorority at Beloit (Wis.) College which pledged a Negro girl is reported to have been placed on probation by its national council. The Des Moines Sunday Register published a story that Delta Gamma received recent notice of the probation action because it pledged Patricia Hamilton 21 a junior from Madison Wis. a month ago. The Register also said that the national council has set June 30 as the date for a decision on whether to suspend the charter of the Beloit chapter. The newspaper quoted Mrs. Robert W. Preston of Roslyn Heights N.Y. national president of Delta Gamma as saying: This is a private organization. When we have disciplinary actions there is no reason why we have to tell anyone about them. This is a completely private affair. Miss Hamilton was described by college officials as a top student who holds several campus positions. She will be president next fall of the Associated Women Students governing body among women on the campus. Phillis Farnsworth 20 a junior from Nashville Tenn. and Beloit chapter president told the Register Miss Hamilton remains a pledge. At Cedar Rapids Iowa Mrs. Russell Nash once president of the sorority chapter at the University of Minnesota said the probation action stems from the pledging of Miss Hamilton. Beloit President Dr. Miller Upton was quoted as saying he doesnt know why the sorority is on probation but would hate to think it is because of pledging the Negro girl. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes you have to see it to believe it. And in rare cases like this one it freaks out observers watching. In the ever-expanding world of humanoid robots a new star is rising and its name is Astribot. The Chinese company’s latest creation the S1 model is turning heads with its astonishing speed and precision. Astribot S1: How it’s breaking speed records. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/freak-robot-made-china-can-learn-think-work-like-humans)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK July 24 - Wiley Post has no illusions about the longevity of that record of seven days 18 hours and 49 minutes he set in his dash around the globe. He thinks someone will break it in the not too distant future. Sitting in comfort in an easy chair for the first time in more than a week Post told yesterday of his adventures fighting the winds and fog of many lands. Asked what the fastest possible time around the world would be he chuckled and said: Oh about 30 seconds I guess. No one really knows but theyre going to go faster and farther. The robot pilot that helped him around the globe made a big hit with Post he disclosed despite some mechanical difficulty. He said hed rather have it than a human co-pilot because it is more accurate. Being a lazy man he said I let the robot do the work as much as possible. I trusted the ship to the robot from Edmonton till I was over Newark airport. It flew it every step from the first takeoff too until 30 minutes before I landed in Germany. Post is sure he could have made the trip in five days if he had the breaks in weather. I thought it was going to be a pleasure trip he said but the weather made it turn out otherwise. But the robot worked pretty well except for the time the oil feed was off. I was more than satisfied with the performance of the Winnie Mae but just the same the journey had its tough spots. The toughest I guess was just before I came down out of the clouds and landed at Flat in Alaska. I was so tired then that I just couldnt use my head. I should have stopped at Nome but I was too anxious to get on I guess. Post who ended his record shattering flight at 10:59 eastern standard time Saturday night had time yesterday only to have a few of the more obvious wrinkles pressed from his gray suit before a busy day began. First a doctor examined him finding his pulse and blood pressure normal. Then came a host of back-thumping friends. Then he visited Floyd Bennett field to look the Winnie Mae over and garner the plaudits of the crowd. Back at his hotel there came the day’s climax a visit from General Italo Balbo. Only a man like you can do something like that the general said his eyes flashing. Oh Post magnificent Magnificent I think said Post that most generals are phony but you have absolutely proven yourself a general to have gone out and taken charge of such a flight as you have made I think it great--extremely great. New York plans an official reception for Post. |

Suppose your phone bell doesnt work. Somebody may be calling you up and looking you over and you not knowing it. And remember dont run direct from the bath tub to the telephone. It also pictures everybody and everything that’s in the room so why hire a detective when you can get evidence for a nickel? We don’t know yet whether its a scientific discovery or a Wayne Wheeler invention. One lucky thing it photographs like water. Yours for the good old days when they couldnt even tell where you were phoning. There will be none installed at Beverly Hills. THE MAYOR. |
