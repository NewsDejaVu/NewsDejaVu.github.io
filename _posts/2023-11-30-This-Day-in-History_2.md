She was found in time to be saved. :<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the death of Wilcox in 1955, Miss Barrymore began the long, uphill struggle for a come- back. She wrote her book, in- cluding the sordid details of her dissipation. She licked her drink- ing problem.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She told friends recently, “I have begun to find my way.”  |
