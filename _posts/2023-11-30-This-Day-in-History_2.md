| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — In his closing arguments for remaining a member of the House, a defiant Rep. George Santos depicted himself as a victim of a smear campaign by some of his colleagues and made clear that he would not resign before a vote Friday on whether he should be expelled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first-term Republican congressman from New York could well become just the sixth member of the House to have been ousted by colleagues. While Santos survived two earlier expulsion efforts, a critical House Ethics Committee report released on Nov. 16 has convinced more members that his actions merit the House’s most severe punishment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will not stand by quietly,” Santos said during Thursday afternoon’s debate on the House floor. “The people of the Third District of New York sent me here. If they want me out, you’re going to have to go silence those people and go take the hard vote.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the previous expulsions in the House, three were for disloyalty to the Union during the Civil War and two were for lawma ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/george-santos-house-expulsion-vote-ethics-d24b4b727da4f6b9af26e5aa902db992](https://apnews.com/article/george-santos-house-expulsion-vote-ethics-d24b4b727da4f6b9af26e5aa902db992) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (UPI) — Ed- ward M. Kennedy dumped veteran Russell B. Long of Louisiana as Senate Democratic whip at the start of the 91st Congress Friday, and the Howse finally seated Adam Clayton Powell of Harlem—for a price.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kennedy’s rare coup in unseating an incumbent party leager was a triumph for resiless young liberals in Congress and a boost to his own political future. It came at a closed caucus of Senate Demo- erats just before Congress convened, The secret ballot tally was 31 to 26.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powell took the seat he had sought in two years of court battles in exile and had technically won in two elections in New York after five hours of public debate on the House floor. The former congress- man’s colleagues again over- rode their leadership's advice and voted, 252 to 160, to fine him and deny him the rights of his 22 years of previous seniority.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kennedy and Powell dramas overshadowed the cere- monial convening of the Demo- eratic-controlled Congress that Richard M. Nixon will have to work with for the next two years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a day of new faces and old problems left over from the Johnson era. One of the new Senate faces that Vice Pres- ident Hubert H. Humphrey swore in was that of Barry M. Goldwater, who left the Senate in 1964 to run unsuccessfully against President Johnson.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While most serious legislative business is expected to await President-elect Nixon’s outlne of plans after Inauguration day Jan, 20, hearings are likely to begin in the meantime on a pay raise for the new president, his cabinet choices and possibly on electoral reform.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leadership had urged that Powell be seated this year without qualification, since he already had been excluded March 1, 1967, for the entire g0th Congress because of alleged payroll and other abuses of office. “Time is a greater healer,’ argued Rep. Emanuel Celler, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But House members balked, fmally settling on making Powell no more than just another freshman congressman and fining him $25,000 over the two years of his new term. The special investigating committee that Celler headed two years ago decided tentatively that Powell owed the government about $40,000, but Powell was never asked to pay that sum and he did not volunteer to do so.  |
