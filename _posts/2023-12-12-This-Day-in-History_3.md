| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DENVER (AP) — Just weeks before the deadline for Colorado to reintroduce gray wolves under a voter-approved initiative, representatives of the cattle industry association are suing state and federal agencies in the hopes of delaying the predators’ release.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gunnison County Stockgrowers’ Association and Colorado Cattlemen’s Association say in the lawsuit filed Monday that U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services failed to adequately review the effects of reintroducing up to 50 wolves over the next several years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carnivores’ planned release in Colorado, voted for in a 2020 ballot measure, has already stirred controversy and sharpened divides between rural and urban residents. City dwellers largely voted to reintroduce the apex predators into the rural areas where prey can include livestock that help drive local economies.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erin Karney, executive vice-president of the Colorado Cattlemen’s Association, said they will also be requesting a temporary restraining order to halt the impending re ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/wolf-reintroduction-colorado-lawsuit-environment-80dd1eeac13b5f6395c4c007a96df7aa](https://apnews.com/article/wolf-reintroduction-colorado-lawsuit-environment-80dd1eeac13b5f6395c4c007a96df7aa) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) — Civilization is closing in, even in the high mountain meadows and rushing streams, and the ani- mals are fading away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grizzly bear and timber wolf are among the threatened species in the lofty Rocky Moun- tain ranges of western Montana and in surrounding states of the 29,096,827-acre northern region of the U.S. Forest Service.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Much Time<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week the Forest Service made public a list of endan- gered and rare species, saying it is time to begin saving these animals, for there is not much time left.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included on the list of endan- gered species, those which face immediate danger of extinction, are the timber wolf, the whoop- ing crane and the Montana westslope cutthroat trout.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listed as rare are the grizzly bear, Arctic grayling, spotted bat and prairie falcon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard Foulger is chief of the division of range and wildlife for the northern region, which includes Montana, North Dako- ta, western South Dakota, north- ern Idaho and eastern Washing- ton. He says:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Interest in the preservation of wildlife has increased re markably in the past few years, but people keep crowding in. The animals may soon have no place to go.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The northern region is lightly populated. Montana, the na- tion’s fourth largest state in land area, has a population of only 694,000, or about 4 persons per square mile.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state was long rich in wildlife, and monuments mark spots where Indian tribes once herded buffalo to the edge of high cliffs, then stampeded them to their deaths,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the reminders of the Wild West, the “buffalo drops,” have been replaced by modern: day killers such as guns and chemicals.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foulger said the region is toc big for maintaining exact counts of species. He said a species is determined to be in danget when sightings are infrequent or few are felled by hunters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding a proper balance be tween the needs of man anc those of wildlife is a perplexing one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cattlemen regard the timbe wolf as the No. 1 threat to live stock in some Northern Regior areas, and fight him with poi son. Conservationists, on the othe hand, see the wolf as a valuable species, a wild, rugged animal an important part of the natura<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; environment which deserves preservation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grizzly bear, huge, amaz- ingly swift and sometimes vi- cious, is a fahled symbol of the rugged mountainous country of the West, but man’s intrusions into the grizzly’s domain have brought tragedy and outcries against the animal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partial Solution<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Park officials have found a partial solution by airlifting the grizzlies to remote areas where meetings with humans are un- likely.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Forest Service has taken a number of steps to alleviate extinction of certain game.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These include monitoring of streams to assure healthy water for fish, curbing poaching, in- cluding that of the endangered peregrine falcon; and coopera- tion with the Audubon Society in counting and protecting such en- dangered species as the whoop- ing crane, Tule white-fronted goose and Eskimo curlew.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Forest Service is control- ling poisoned bait programs for predators in some parts of the Northern Region, avoiding chemical use in areas where timber wolves and other endan: gered species might roam.  |
