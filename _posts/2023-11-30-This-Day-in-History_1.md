| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — In his closing arguments for remaining a member of the House, a defiant Rep. George Santos depicted himself as a victim of a smear campaign by some of his colleagues and made clear that he would not resign before a vote Friday on whether he should be expelled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first-term Republican congressman from New York could well become just the sixth member of the House to have been ousted by colleagues. While Santos survived two earlier expulsion efforts, a critical House Ethics Committee report released on Nov. 16 has convinced more members that his actions merit the House’s most severe punishment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will not stand by quietly,” Santos said during Thursday afternoon’s debate on the House floor. “The people of the Third District of New York sent me here. If they want me out, you’re going to have to go silence those people and go take the hard vote.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the previous expulsions in the House, three were for disloyalty to the Union during the Civil War and two were for lawma ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/george-santos-house-expulsion-vote-ethics-d24b4b727da4f6b9af26e5aa902db992](https://apnews.com/article/george-santos-house-expulsion-vote-ethics-d24b4b727da4f6b9af26e5aa902db992) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOSCOW ( UPI)—Rep. James H. Scheuer, D-N.Y., expelled by the Soviets, said he was leaving today convinced he had done nothing improper by investigat- ing the status of Soviet Jews.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheuer was ordered expelled Friday on unspecified charges of “improper activity’’—the first elected U.S. official ever kicked out of the Soviet Union. He had toured the country with a congressional group invited to study Soviet education.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“T am astonished and puzzled as to what might have motivated the Soviets to do this,’ Scheuer said by tele- phone from his Leningrad hotel Friday night.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“T’ve met with six or eight Jewish Soviet citizens who wish to emigrate. This is not a crime under Soviet law and indeed the right to emigrate is assured to Soviet citizens by virtue of Soviet ratification of various U.N. documents.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this week Scheuer was arrested by Moscow police at the home of a Jewish scientist who had applied unsuccessfully to emigrate to Israel. Police held Scheuer for 40 minutes and freed him with the explanation the arrest was a case of ‘‘mistaken identity.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheuer, a Jew, said he had broken no Soviet law in his contacts with Soviet Jews and had even tried to “avoid controversy” out of considera- tion for President Nixon’s<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forthcoming visit. A U.S. Embassy spokesmar said the Soviets had declined tc<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specify what “improper ac tivities’? Scheuer was accused of. The embassy statement indicated its assumption the Jewish question was the crux.  |
