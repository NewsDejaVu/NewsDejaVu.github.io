| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (AP) — A New York appeals court Thursday reinstated a gag order that barred Donald Trump from commenting about court personnel after the former president repeatedly disparaged a law clerk in his New York civil fraud trial.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-sentence decision came two weeks after an individual appellate judge put the gag order on hold while the appeals process played out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trial judge Arthur Engoron, who imposed the restriction, said he now planned to enforce it “rigorously and vigorously.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trump attorney Christopher Kise called it “a tragic day for the rule of law.” Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, complained that the gag order was “nothing but attempted election interference, which is failing terribly.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engoron imposed the gag order Oct. 3 after Trump posted a derogatory comment about the judge’s law clerk to social media.

Court of Appeals today upheld, 8-1, dismissal of the main count of the perjury indictment against Owen Lattimore—that he lied in denying he was a Commun- ist sympathizer or a promoter of Red causes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court reinstated by a 5-4 vote two more counts which a dis- trict court judge had thrown out when the controversial Far East specialist was called to trial. But these two were accusations which attorneys had treated as side is- sues.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves Two Choices<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's ruling confronted the Justice Department with this choice:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Supreme Court to put the key count back in force; or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To go to trial on the two re- instated counts plus three which U. 8S. Dist. Judge Luther W. Youngdahl had let stand with a comment that he doubted they would “pass the test of materiali- ty so as to present a jury issue.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the trial court threw out the charges government lawyers said they planned to go all the way to the highest court if neces- sary to get them back.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lattimore Elated<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, however, the department said the appeals court opinion will have to be studied carefully before a decision is reached on the next step.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lattimore himself, reached at his home in Baltimore, said the ruling was “clearly a major victo- ry.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in Washington his lawyers, Joseph C. O'Mahoney and Thur- man Arnold, said the 8-1 vote of the court of appeals on the major count “has destroyed any substan-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;een = re See LATTIMORE. Page 12  |
