| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — In his closing arguments for remaining a member of the House, a defiant Rep. George Santos depicted himself as a victim of a smear campaign by some of his colleagues and made clear that he would not resign before a vote Friday on whether he should be expelled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first-term Republican congressman from New York could well become just the sixth member of the House to have been ousted by colleagues. While Santos survived two earlier expulsion efforts, a critical House Ethics Committee report released on Nov. 16 has convinced more members that his actions merit the House’s most severe punishment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will not stand by quietly,” Santos said during Thursday afternoon’s debate on the House floor. “The people of the Third District of New York sent me here. If they want me out, you’re going to have to go silence those people and go take the hard vote.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the previous expulsions in the House, three were for disloyalty to the Union during the Civil War and two were for lawma ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/george-santos-house-expulsion-vote-ethics-d24b4b727da4f6b9af26e5aa902db992](https://apnews.com/article/george-santos-house-expulsion-vote-ethics-d24b4b727da4f6b9af26e5aa902db992) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (UPI) — Rep. Wayne Hays’ decision to resign only one of his two committee na gg because of the Elizabeth y sex scandal failed to curb demands that he give up his second important<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;post.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ohio Democrat agreed Thursday to have ‘‘a temporary chairman” replace him on the Democratic Congressional Cam- paign Committee “until the charge against me has been resolved.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he ignored requests to quit his more important post as head of the House Administra- tion Committee, which oversees the housekeeping chores of the House — including the many perquisites that mean money and comfort for the members.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is no way he can satisfy the membership without stepping down from both,”’ said House Democratic leader Thomas O'Neill of Massa- chusetts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don't think the member- ship is satisfied with Hays pe aside from one area and not the other,’ said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven House Democrats have said they will ask a party caucus this month to strip Hays of the administration chairman- ship.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hays stepped down from his campaign committee position as the House Ethics Committee began investigating Miss Ray's charge that Hays put her on a subcommittee payroll at $14,00¢ a year solely to serve as his mistress. Hays admits they had a long affair before his April marriage but denies he hired her for that purpose.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chairman John Flynt, D-Ga. said the investigation ‘will not necessarily be confined t allegations made against an one person.’ This indicated the panel might look into rumorec sexual escapades of othe members of Congress.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flynt said staff investigator:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would interview principals and witnesses, including Hays, for “at least a week"’ before the committee itself takes tes- timony.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informed sources said that the Justice Department is considering a civil suit to collect damages from Hays for Miss Ray's salary. Under the False Claims Act, the govern- ment could collect a $2,000 penenay and double indemnity or any government loss if the charges were proved.  |
