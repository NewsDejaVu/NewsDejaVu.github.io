Its key feature is the development of centers in communities throughout the nation in which residents could receive outpatient as well as in-patient care for mental ills. Dropped from the bill was a controversial feature that would have provided $427 million to assist local communities in paying the salaries of psychiatrists psychologists and other professional workers. |

| When And Where Can I See The Total Solar Eclipse? What To Know About The Path Of Totality | Eclipse To Begin At 2:15 On Sunday Afternoon |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you dont already live on the total solar eclipses path of totality you may want to make plans to get somewhere to catch a glimpse of the spectacular sight on April 8. Not only is this the last time for 20 years that the moons orbit will cause it to directly blot out the suns disk anywhere in the United States but we may never see an eclipse quite like this again in our lifetime. The suns outermost layer known as the corona will be brighter the moon will appear larger and the night ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/09/when-is-the-total-solar-eclipse/72786683007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rare spectacle in the daytime sky will be seen on April 7 throughout most of North America when the sun stages a blackout known to science as the annular eclipse. This solar phenomenon will be best seen in a strip of land about 160 miles wide extending entirely across the continent. Here the maximum phase will present a narrow ring of light around the moons shadow. The term annular comes from the Latin annulus meaning ring. A year ago there was an annular eclipse observed in Arctic regions but there will not be another blackout of this kind in the U.S. until 1994. At the time of the eclipse the moon will be at about its greatest distance from the earth. Its shadow will appear too small to entirely cover the suns disk so totality will occur nowhere. The central line of the zone where the annular phase may be seen comes very near the following localities: Chihuahua Mex. a spot midway between Austin and Houston Tex. New Orleans Biloxi Miss. Tallahassee and Jacksonville Fla. Along this line the ring phase will last from 6 to 7.5 minutes varying with the locality. From places within approximately 80 miles both north and south of this central line the eclipse will appear annular but the ring will at no time be perfectly symmetrical. It will become more lopsided the farther the observer is located from the line. Immediately outside the annular zone the maximum phase will show a thin crescent of light. As the distance from this zone increases the percentage of the suns eclipsed diameter will decrease. At Minneapolis it will be 56 per cent; at Juneau Alaska only six per cent. Amateurs photographing this eclipse with ordinary cameras will find very slow film small stops and the shortest possible exposures will bring best results. If the camera is allowed to stand undisturbed and the sun is shot every five or 10 minutes a series of images on one picture may be obtained. The simplest method for viewing the phenomenon is the use of smoked glass or photographic negative. Excellent views may be obtained through field glasses the front lenses of which should be properly darkened. |
