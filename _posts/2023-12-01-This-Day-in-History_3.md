| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazon announced Friday that it has signed a contract with SpaceX, its main rival in the internet satellite business, for three launches of its Kuiper satellites as it faces a deadline to get its spacecraft into orbit.

ArrowRight The contract is a victory for SpaceX and further demonstration that its Falcon 9 rocket has become the workhorse for the United States space industry. It also comes months after an Amazon shareholder accused the company in a lawsuit of not awarding a launch contract to SpaceX because of a rivalry between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and SpaceX founder Elon Musk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazon previously had announced contracts with three other rocket companies, including Blue Origin, Bezos’s space venture. But none of those rockets has ever flown, and under its license from the Federal Communications Commission, Amazon needs to get half of the 3,236 satellites it plans for its service into orbit by July 2026.

(AP) -—A mammoth Saturn 5 rocket rolled slowly to a launch pad to- day as the three-man Apollo 8 crew that may ride it into orbit about the moon in December watched and posed for pictures with the giant booster.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time prepara- tions moved flawlessly toward Friday’s launching of the three- man Apollo 7 crew on a mara- thon earth orbit flight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Apollo 7 prelaunch ac- tivity is going as smooth as we've ever seen for a manned space flight,’’ commented an of- ficial of the National Aeronau- tics and Space Administration<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two events—rollout and preparation—demonstrate that after 20 months this nation’s man-in-space program has re. covered from the tragic fire<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that killed three astronauts and once again is on the course to the moon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 363-foot-tall Saturn 5 lum- bered at a snail’s pace out of a cavernous assembly building at 8:30 a.m, EDT. With the Apollo 8 spaceship perched on top, it rode upright on the back of a diesel-powered transporter that resembles a giant mechanical turtle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transporter, traveling at less than one mile an hour, was expected to take about eight hours to make the 3.5-mile trip to the launch pad.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Apollo 8 crew—Air Force Col. Frank Borman, Navy Capt. James A. Lovell Jr., and Air Force Maj. William A. Anders —observed the rollout and posed for news photographers with the gigantic rocket in the back- ground.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The astronauts’ hopes of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flying Apollo 8 into orbit around the moon depend on the results of Apollo 7, which is scheduled to ride a smaller Saturn 1B rocket into earth orbit at 11 a.m, EDT Friday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Navy Capt. Walter M. Schir- ra Jr., Air Force Maj. Donn F. Eisele and civilian astronaut Walter Cunningham are to check out all spacecraft sys- tems as they race around the globe for 11 days in the Apollo 7 ship. If they demonstrate conclu- sively that the Apollo craft can safely carry men a quarter-of- a-million miles to the moon and bring them back, the Borman crew plans to take off Dec. 20 on an eight-day trip in which they are to orbit the moon 10 times during a 24-hour period. That flight would be a critical re- hearsal for a manned lunar landing in 1969.  |
