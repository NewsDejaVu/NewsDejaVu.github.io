| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazon announced Friday that it has signed a contract with SpaceX, its main rival in the internet satellite business, for three launches of its Kuiper satellites as it faces a deadline to get its spacecraft into orbit.

ArrowRight The contract is a victory for SpaceX and further demonstration that its Falcon 9 rocket has become the workhorse for the United States space industry. It also comes months after an Amazon shareholder accused the company in a lawsuit of not awarding a launch contract to SpaceX because of a rivalry between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and SpaceX founder Elon Musk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazon previously had announced contracts with three other rocket companies, including Blue Origin, Bezos’s space venture. But none of those rockets has ever flown, and under its license from the Federal Communications Commission, Amazon needs to get half of the 3,236 satellites it plans for its service into orbit by July 2026.

Hagen, director of the U.S. satel- lite program known as Project Vanguard, appears to support pre- vious statements by American scientists that Soviet rocket was something close to an interconti- nental ballistic missile.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagen said in a National Press Club talk Friday that this country once hoped to be ready to launch a scientific satellite in October this year. The hope now is to get one up next March.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64 Nations In IGY<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Soviet and U.S. proj- ects were scheduled as programs of the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in which 64 nations are: collectively seeking new infor- mation about the earth and its en- vironment in space.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagen said this country for the past couple of years had ‘‘frank- ly” and “openly” discussed with other IGY countries. its satellite- launching plans. He said the Rus- sians knew two years ago that the U.S. ‘‘working plans’’ called for a possible satellite shot this month.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This and other IGY countries, however, were told nothing about the Soviet launching schedule. When the news came from Mos- cow a week ago Friday that a made-in-Russia moon was in orbit, the immediate effect here was shocked surprise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reds Called “Unethical”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked Friday if he thought the Russians were guilty of ‘‘unethical conduct,’’ Hagen smiled ruefully. From his personal viewgoint,’’ “definitely,” he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagen repeated President Ei- senhower'’s statement of Monday that the United States could have fired a satellite into an 18,000- mile-an-hour flight around the earth before now if Vanguard had been ‘merged with the American hallistic missile program. _,,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the scientific and military rocket programs were kept sepa- rate, the military got the top pri- ority, and Vanguard had ‘to make do with modified versions of exist- ing research rockets.  |
