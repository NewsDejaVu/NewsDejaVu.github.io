| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (AP) — Flu is picking up steam while RSV lung infections that can hit kids and older people hard may be peaking, U.S. health officials said Friday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COVID-19, though, continues to cause the most hospitalizations and deaths among respiratory illnesses — about 15,000 hospitalizations and about 1,000 deaths every week, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency is also looking into reports of pneumonia outbreaks in children in two states, but Cohen said “there is no evidence” that they are due to anything unusual.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the flu season, seven states were reporting high levels of flu-like illnesses in early November.

The center said currently localized flu epidem- ics were responsible for the extra deaths.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Lawrence Corry, medical epidemiologist with the CDC, said the figures had improved since the previous week when there were 754 deaths, 223 more than expected.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all of the flu activity, which started in December, is of the Port Chalmers A-type variety. A specific vaccine is required for protection, Corry said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corry said influenza  out- breaks were just starting in some parts of the country, such as the West Coast, while there were indications it may have peaked in the Southeast region, where the first cases of the Port Chalmers flu were reported in early December.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest states to report flu activity were California, Ore- gon, New Mexico, Massa- chusetts and New Hampshire, where school absenteeism and admissions to medical care facilities were up.  |
