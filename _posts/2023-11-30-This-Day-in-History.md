In its journey from urban planning circles to the public arena, some have falsely claimed it will imprison people within a 15-minute radius of their homes (it’s about convenience and freedom, advocates argue, not isolation). Some urban planners object to the idea. They say that not everyone’s workplace can be within a 15 minute walk, shrinking a metropolitan area’s job market.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But amid smoldering housing and climate crises, the 15-minute-city concept offers a way out of both, reducing our dependence on cars to go about our daily lives and freeing us to spend our time as we choose.
