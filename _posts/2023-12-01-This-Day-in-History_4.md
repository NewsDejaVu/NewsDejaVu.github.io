Telegraph Co. said Friday it hopes to put up within a year the first commer- cial space satellite as the fore- runner of a communications relay network in the sky.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orbiting sphere would’ be used to transmit telephone calls, television and other types of com- munication between the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial transmissions would be experimental, Following satis- factory: tests, the’ company said, commercial service would be of- fered to the public. ;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AT&T applied to -the Federal Communications Commission for authority to go ahead with the project, It said it is ready to con- tract for launching of the satellite and to begin construction of ground transmission and receiving stations,   Administrator T. Keith Glennan of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has said NASA will make available to pri- vate companies at cost rockets, launching and tracking facilities and technical services. AT&T said it would work closely with NASA.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only artificial earth satel- lites launched thus far have been<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘under government control, by this country and the Soviet Union,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AT&T made no estimate of the total costs of the project, which it said it will finance and operate in coordination with telephone ad- ministrations abroad.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It said the system it contem- plates will include an unspecified number of satellites, and that when they are in production the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost to put each one into space will be about $1 million.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The satellites AT&T proposes will orbit at an altitude of 2,200 miles and will be powered by solar batteries,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We believe the commercial application of satellite communi- cations is a job for private en- terprise,” AT&T Vice President Henry T. Killingsworth said.  |
