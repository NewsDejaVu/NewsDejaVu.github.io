The ethics report also found “substantial evidence” that Santos knowingly violated ethics guidelines, House rules and criminal laws.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santos is the sixth lawmaker to be expelled from the chamber, and the first to be removed without having been convicted of a crime.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santos also faces 23 federal criminal counts, including fraud, money laundering, falsi ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/05/ny-santos-special-election/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/05/ny-santos-special-election/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} SMLUMNDIA, 0..." (UPL) - ror mee Rep. Albert Watson, stripped of his seniority for sup- porting Barry Goldwater for president, announced Tuesday he will resign from Congress to seek re-election as a Republi- can.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ Watson said he would resign “the date following a special election which will be set by ‘the governor.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  But the governor, Donald Rus- sell, said he had no intention of calling a special election. A spokesman for the governor said Russell was following a section of the U.S. constitution that provides for special elec- tions only after a vacancy has occurred.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Advised of this, Watson said “if he concludes that it is best that the people not have repre- sentation through the time of the special election, then I shall resign.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watson made his announce- ment to a news conference at- tended by more than 100 Repub- licans, including Sen. Strom Thurmond who bolted the Dem- ocrat party in September to sup- port Goldwater.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thurmond and Watson ex- changed lavish praise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I'm not worthy to tie your shoe strings,’’ Watson told Thurmond. “But I will enjoy working with you in the party.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thurmond described Watson’s<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;announcement as ‘‘one of the great statements by a great statesman of this era.” - “The Democrats treated him in a shabby manner,” said Thur- mond. “He will feel very much more at home within the Repub- lican party.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The people of South Carolina will be proud of Albert Watson and will back him up and re- elect him overwhelmingly in the special election,’ Thurmond ‘said,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Watson and Rep. John Bell<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Williams, D-Miss., were stripped of their congressional seniority by House Democrats because both has openly endorsed Gold- water.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watson angrily left Washing- ton, saying he refused to be a<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “second class’’ Democrat. Watson said he first decided to become a Republican, and having made that decision was next faced with the problem of “whether or not I should resign<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Turn to Page A4, Col, 2)  |
