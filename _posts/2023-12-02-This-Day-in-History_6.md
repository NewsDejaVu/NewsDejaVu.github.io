| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of Elon Musk’s biggest business clients are rethinking their relationship with his tech empire amid a fresh spurt of controversial behavior. Now, so is Congress. Since Musk parroted antisemitic tropes and boosted a debunked conspiracy theory about child sex trafficking, some lawmakers are calling for the federal government to reevaluate its relationship with the tech mogul, whose companies receive billions of dollars in federal contracts. Some lawmakers said they were particularly concerned by a September report that Musk restricted access to a satellite network critical to Ukraine’s fight against Russia.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The idea that battlefield decisions are contingent upon his goodwill, that’s not a great position to be in,” Sen.

Johnson was vice president and president.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 5,000 new federal jobs materialized in the capital city of Texas during those eight years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austin is Johnson’s second hometown, a 45-minute drive from the LBJ Ranch. It is the location of his federal office, li- brary and many of his business interests.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, the Veterans Ad- ministration notified a longtime Johnson friend, Rep. J. J. Pick- le, that it is reevaluating plans to transfer data-processing sys-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tems from Hines, Ill., to Aus- tin’s VA computer complex.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first contingent of the Of- fice of Economic Opportunity’s 230 regional headquarters work- ers have been transferred to Dallas, Those still in Austin will be moved soon, an OEO official here said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order to move the region- al office from Austin came soon after President Nixon took com- mand,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the GOP officials have put up obstacles to delay—if not thwart—plans by some of John- son’s colleagues to build an old folks home on surplus federal land deeded them without charges six weeks before John- son left the presidency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank Erwin, a University of Texas regent, auto dealer Roy<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Butler and Banker John Burns formed the Austin Geriatric Center, Inc., and applied for 26.5 acres of surplus land that used to be a federal fish hatch- ery. They didn’t get their tax- exempt license from the Inter- nal Revenue Service until last December, however, and the Health, Education and Welfare Department says the Erwin group should return the land un- til a legal review of the swift property deed action in late 1968 is completed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Veterans Administration action to delay transfer of the Hines project came to light Fri- day when Sen. Ralph Yarbor- ough, D-Tex., made public a let- ter to VA administrator Donald FE, Johnson asking reasons for the apparent reversal.  |
