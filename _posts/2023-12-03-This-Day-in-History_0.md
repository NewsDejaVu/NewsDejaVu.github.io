| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Ballistic missiles fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels struck three commercial ships Sunday in the Red Sea, while a U.S. warship shot down three drones in self-defense during the hourslong assault, the U.S. military said. The Iranian-backed Houthis claimed two of the attacks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strikes marked an escalation in a series of maritime attacks in the Mideast linked to the Israel-Hamas war, as multiple vessels found themselves in the crosshairs of a single Houthi assault for the first time in the conflict. The U.S. vowed to “consider all appropriate responses” in the wake of the attack, specifically calling out Iran, after tensions have been high for years now over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“These attacks represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security,” the U.S. military’s Central Command said in a statement. “They have jeopardized the lives of international crews representing multiple countries around the world.”  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-houthi-yemen-ships-attack-israel-hamas-war-gaza-strip-716770f0a780160e9abed98d3c48fbde](https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-houthi-yemen-ships-attack-israel-hamas-war-gaza-strip-716770f0a780160e9abed98d3c48fbde) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Soviets have started sending Cuba bigger. more  heavilv armed — missile-firing patrol boats, Pentagon sources report. The first two OSA-class boats reached Havana in mid- January<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They arrived nearly a month after Cuban gunboat attacks on two unarmed Panamanian-reg- istered freighters in the Carib- bean brought U.S. warnings of possible air and naval counter- action.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 35-knot OSAs mount four Styx missiles with  high-ex- -plosive warheads and a range of about 15 miles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US. Navy has heen concerned about the Styx since the Egyptians sank an Israeli destroyer with one of them in 1967,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, the Indian navy reportediy sank a Paki- Siani destroyer with a Soviet- supplied Styx.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new 200-ton OSA craft have a greater operating range and carry twice as many mis- ‘siles launchers as the 18 older Komar-cluss patrol boats fur- nished to Cuba by the Russians in the 1960s.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last October, Russia made deliveries of MIG2! jet fighters to Cuba for the first time in more than four years. The pro- vision of newer and more-pow- erful missile boats is viewed by some Pentagon officials as an- other indication that the Soviet Union is embarked on a pro- gram of strengthening Cuba's armed forces.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence officials told a House Foreign Affairs subcom- mittee last September that most of Cuba’s weapons pre- date the 1962 missile crisis, and that Soviet shipments in recent years have consisted largely of spare parts and replacements.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, a Russian guided- missile frigate and a diesel- powered submarine left Cuba last week after nearly three months during which they en- gaged in antisubmarine ex- ercises with the Cubans.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ This was the longest such vis- it by Soviet fighting ships since the Russian navy began send- ing fleet units to Cuba in July 1969.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. reconnaissance has kept constant watch on the port of Cienfuegos, on Cuba's south coast, where the Russians have moored barges and built bar- racks and other facilities that could be used to support sub- ‘marine operations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ The Russians have been re- ported conducting research in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mex- ico on such phenomena as sea currents, water temperatures and composition. Experts say this kind of information would be important to the Soviets for ‘any submarine operations there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Denton<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classified Ads get the “best   results!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ee<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   |
