| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas on Friday released 24 hostages it held captive in Gaza for weeks, and Israel freed 39 Palestinians from prison in the first stage of a swap under a four-day cease-fire that offered a small glimmer of relief to both sides.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel — wrenched by the abduction of nearly 240 people in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war — cheered as 13 Israeli women and children emerged free from Gaza. Most were in their 70s or 80s, and the youngest was a 2-year-old. Also released were 10 people from Thailand and one from the Philippines.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Gaza, the truce’s start Friday morning brought the first quiet for 2.3 million Palestinians reeling and desperate from relentless Israeli bombardment that has killed thousands, driven three-quarters of the population from their homes and leveled residential areas. Rocket fire from Gaza militants into Israel went silent as well.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased supplies of food, water, medicine and fuel promised under the deal began to roll into Gaza,  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-11-24-2023-172256dd593189f7b37f7c62f4739c6b](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-11-24-2023-172256dd593189f7b37f7c62f4739c6b) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URICU FICSS ABC Rawle<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palestinian guerrilla leader Yasser Arafat ordered his men to fortify their positions in the besieged Moslem sector of Beirut today, but the eighth cease-fire of the war in Lebanon held into its second day.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lebanese negotiators said the Palestine Liberation Organiza- tion guerrillas could begin leaving in two weeks and Israel warned it would step up its attacks on the city if the Palestinians delayed their departure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fierce Israeli bombardment of west Beirut Friday killed at least 20 people and injured 50, police said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beirut Radio said Friday’s bombardment hit an ammunition dump and a PLO army unit where 18 fighters died, as well as an area where guerrillas stationed giant Grad missiles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arafat ordered his men to fortify their positions in preparation for more intense bombardment of the city, security sources said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lebanese police sources said that in 34 hours Friday, Israeli warplanes, field artillery and gunboats fired more than 1,200 shells of various calibers into the western half of Beirut.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The shelling continued for 342 hours. At one point the Beirut sky was red. Fires were burning out of control. It was like hell,” said a resident of Mansourieh, a Christian suburb in the hills 3<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miles east of Beirut, describing the effects of Friday’s bombing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PLO, meanwhile, awaited word from U.S. envoy Philip Habib on its first public pledge to leave Beirut. Former Prime Minister Saeb Salam, a key go-between, said a Palestinian with- drawal could being in two or three weeks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a ranking PLO official said the troops wanted 28 days from the arrival of a multinational disengagement force to move an estimated 6,000 fighters to the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon, along the border with Syria.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Washington, Egyptian Foreign Minister Kamal Hassan Ali told the United States Friday that settlement of the war in Lebanon would open the way to direct dialogue between the United States and the PLO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three hours of intense fighting Friday broke a 43-hour cease-fire that started Wednesday after a week of intense air raids. It came amid reports of an imminent breakthrough in U.S.-led diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tel Aviv, the military command blamed the latest fighting on “‘continuous (PLO) violations’’ of the previous cease-fire. “Israel does not consider itself bound by a unilateral cease- fire,” the command said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official Beirut Radio said the Israeli air raids followed an artillery exchange between Israeli and Palestinian forces around Beirut airport. Israel accused the Palestinians of starting the duel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three and a half hours after the Israeli bombers returned to west Beirut, Habib patched together a new cease-fire which went into effect at 9 p.m., or 3 p.m. EDT.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, five Israeli shells hit the already badly damaged Soviet Embassy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palestinian fighters responded by firing into Christian east Beirut, where Israeli troops are stationed. They hit a Lebanese television station and Hamziyeh suburb.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israeli bombardment also hit a number of densely populated, non-Palestinian civilian areas, some of them never before bombed, witnesses said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palestinian and Lebanese officials said the areas included the plush Rauche seafront suburb, the expensive Verdun Street, the Sunni Moslem Tallat al Thayyat suburb and Vasta, a Sunni- Shiite area.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But residents of the Tallat al Thayyat, a hilltop suburb, said<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the neighborhood had a number of artillery emplacements.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Jerusalem, an official announcement that Prime Minister Menachem Begin was postponing his official visit to Zaire by at least two weeks spurred speculation an agreement for the peaceful evacuation of the PLO fighters from Beirut was near.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Begin later said Israel still did not know the PLO’s real intentions and a Begin aide denied any connection between the postponement of the Zaire trip and the Lebanese crisis.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister rejected a dramatic plea by Labor Party chairman Shimon Peres to stop staging bombing Beirut, and said the PLO could face harsher siege conditions, capture or even annihilation if it refuses to leave.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir was in Geneva en route to the United States and talks with President Reagan, Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.  |
