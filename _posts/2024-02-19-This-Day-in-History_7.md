| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ATLANTA (AP) — Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis took the witness stand Thursday and forcefully pushed back against what she described as “lies” about her romantic relationship with a special prosecutor during an extraordinary hearing over misconduct allegations that threaten to upend one of four criminal cases against Donald Trump. A visibly upset Willis who originally fought to stay off the witness stand agreed to testify after a previous witness said her relationship with special ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/fani-willis-hearing-trump-case-potential-conflict-c37fcf993ac33c150f3cb3e4a7a888db)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica cracking down on quarreling lawyers warned Thursday he will not let the Watergate cover-up trial deteriorate into ‘‘a carnival atmosphere.” “I mean it he told attorneys for both the prosecution and the defense with the jury out of the courtroom. “If I dont get your cooperation I will have to do something about it.” Emotions ran high and tempers flared frequently on the 18th day of the trial as lawyers leaped to their feet with objections to questions asked the only witness heard thus far —former White House counsel John W. Dean III. At mid-afternoon Sirica called a recess and came back with a statement he said he was ‘‘sorry to have to make.” Sirica’s warning came after defense attorneys cross-examining Dean failed to trip him up on any major inconsistencies in the story that has made him the government’s star witness against five former White House or election aides to Richard M. Nixon. “I think frankly that this is a very serious case” Sirica said. ‘‘It is serious not only for the defendants but for members of their families —their wives their children their friends. I consider this a serious case and I don’t want this case to have what they call a carnival atmosphere to it. We ought to try it just like any other type of case.” He said he realized there was “‘a lot of tension stress and strain’ in such a major trial. But he said he could not continue to. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (AP) — A few months ago Derek Carrier started seeing someone and became infatuated. He experienced a “ton” of romantic feelings but he also knew it was an illusion. That’s because his girlfriend was generated by artificial intelligence. Carrier wasn’t looking to develop a relationship with something that wasn’t real nor did he want to become the brunt of online jokes. But he did want a romantic partner he’d never had in part because of a genetic disorder called Marfan syndrome tha ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/ai-girlfriend-boyfriend-replika-paradot-113df1b9ed069ed56162793b50f3a9fa)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOLLYWOOD — A handsome young couple started their second year of married bliss today. An electronic brain chose them as ideal mates. Pretty Shirley Saunders and affable Bob Kardell hit it off from the first. They dated a year before they got married. Now theyre happily ensconced in a suburban apartment with just one pressing problem—buying a house. They celebrated their first anniversary Sunday with dinner at a fashionable restaurant and a session of Hawaiian music at a Sunset Strip night club. They met on Art Linkletter’s television show “People Are Funny.” A nationwide audience chuckled as what started as a gag unfolded week by week into a real love affair. Linkletter was best man at their wedding Oct. 18 1958. Before they met they filled out forms telling what they sought in a mate. Both feel they got what they ordered. He wanted a tall blue-eyed blonde. She’s 5 feet 7½ with a pair of devastating blue eyes. She wanted a tall man who was sympathetic and understanding. He’s 6 foot 3 handsome and with an easy disarming manner. Both are 21. Do they credit Univac—the electronic brain — for their marriage? “Were grateful to the show for bringing us together” Bob says. “But we would have fallen in love no matter how we met.” Shirley agrees. She puts it like this: “If two people are right for each other they’re right for each other.” |

| Dems Embrace Tougher Border Enforcement Seeing Trump Demolition Of Deal As Gift | Kilgore Rips Ike On Immigration |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate’s border proposal was one of the toughest bipartisan bills to emerge on the issue in decades. Yet it quickly collapsed when Republicans — galvanized by Donald Trump the likely Republican presidential nominee — rejected the compromise as insufficient. Now Democrats see an opening. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called Trump’s rejection of the border legislation “a gift” for Democrats and said they plan to “constantly over the next year” remind voters that it ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/democrats-border-security-congress-trump-57f62a34ce9c4c08d6e00795fcb24764)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON Sept. 11 - Sen. Kilgore (D-WVa) declared today the Eisenhower Administration has ducked every invitation to tell Congress how it stands on proposed changes in the controversial McCarran-Walter Immigration Act. Kilgore chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and its Immigration subcommittee said the administration has failed to come to grips with this vital issue and formulate a policy. Since last April he said efforts have been made to get Secretary of State Dulles and other top policy spokesmen to testify before his subcommittee. But the senator added the administration has failed to cooperate. Kilgore recalled that President Eisenhower in his 1952 election campaign criticized the McCarran-Walter Act but said so far the President has not submitted a single specific recommendation for changing it. The act the nations basic immigration and naturalization law was passed in 1952 over former President Trumans veto. It has been a continuing source of conflict. Eisenhower among others has said the law contains unjust and discriminatory provisions. Yesterday one of its sponsors Rep. Walter (D-Pa) reviewed immigration figures for the last three years and said qualified aliens are not being kept out of the United States. Walter said the 858536 aliens listed in preliminary Justice Department reports as having been admitted in the year ended last June 30 represented a 14 per cent increase over the previous year. And 1954 he said recorded an increase of 22 per cent over 1953. |

| China Sets World Record For Fastest Hyperloop Train | We Talk Fast Go Slowly. A New Train Idea Germany Has Brains |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine traveling from New York to Los Angeles in less than an hour or from London to Paris in 15 minutes. Sounds impossible right? Well not for China’s biggest missile manufacturer which claims to have built the fastest train ever. The China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) has been working on a hyperloop train that can hit incredibly high speeds in a vacuum. The idea is to take a confined tube – big enough to fit a train – and suck all the air out so that there’s no air ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/china-sets-world-record-fastest-hyperloop-train)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By ARTHUR BRISBANE Al Williams one of our finest young American fliers recently of the American Army said yesterday “the United States talks fast and flies slowly. England flies fast and talks slowly.” Britain holds all the speed records that have any real meaning the airplane record 357 miles per hour the automobile record 246 miles the motor boat record of over 100 miles and motor cycle record of over 150 miles. And they have achieved these records in hard times. The British manage to do what they have to do. Incidentally the British are far ahead of us in the construction of airplane and other engines. They have developed horsepower in their engines by methods concerning which we know nothing. For instance they took a 850 horsepower engine weighing 1540 pounds and got out of it 1900 horsepower the engine weighing less than one pound per horse power. Perhaps our big oil companies could tell us what the British put in their engines to get such horsepower and make them go so fast. The composition of their fuel is a mystery to American engine builders. This year the Italians British and French will compete in the Schneider cup race for the world’s speed records. Uncle Sam who invented the airplane will be absent. What’s the matter with us? Are we getting too old fat and rich? The important news today that will be important 1000 years hence is the news of a really fast railroad in Switzerland. Its coaches made of light aluminum will weigh only three tons each and be driven by airplane propellers will travel 223 miles an hour. Such a train would take passengers from New York to San Francisco in 14 hours. You will get such trains in the United States eventually. The Germans yesterday with 60000 looking on launched their first so-called “Pocket” Cruiser a fighting ship with which Germans demonstrate their superior engineering and military intelligence. It is a small vessel much smaller than some that France and the United States are building but far superior in every way. A great number of small compartments in the new cruiser named Deutschland resist the discharge of several torpedoes or mines. Six eleven-inch guns mounted in armored triple turrets have a range of 17 miles. This German ship could destroy every existing 10000 ton cruiser including United States and French cruisers with no danger to herself. With Diesel engines the new German fighting unit more brilliantly designed than any other in the world has a cruising range of 10000 miles. We have the money and France won the victory but Germany seems to have the brains in this case most important of all. Nicholas M. Schenck president of Loew’s Incorporated which operates hundreds of theatres here and abroad and of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer one of the two greatest producing companies announces a policy that deserves the strongest public approval. Mr. Schenck will not permit either of the companies to exhibit or make any films inspired by advertising interests. He says: “Screened advertising is a menace to the motion picture industry and should be barred by all first-class theatres.” Good advertising is admirable but disguised advertising or open advertising on the screen is indefensible. The “Elgin Marbles” pride of Great Britain most precious possession of the British museum really belong to Greece. Lord Elgin for whom they are named when British ambassador to Constantinople long ago packed up the marbles in Athens and carried them to Britain a kind of piracy then justified. Lord Byron called down on him “the curse of Minerva” but it didn’t seem to work. Now the British consider returning the Elgin Marbles to their old place on the Acropolis at Athens to prove how honest the British are. It is a noble impulse. On the other hand for one person who would see the marbles at Athens a hundred will see them in the British museum. And returning stolen goods of that sort might be a dangerous precedent. We get many of our new ideas from Europe and here is one. Germany now numbers towns and cities to save mistakes and time. Dortmund for instance is number 32. The new system will keep letters freight and express from going astray. |

| European Space Agency Predicts When Dead Satellite Likely To Return To Earth | Dying Sputnik May Crash This Weekend |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went up therefore it has to come down. A defunct satellite is set to return to Earth this week after completing its over-a-decade mission. ERS-2 one of the European Space Agency\s first advanced Earth observing satellites will make a natural re-entry after staying in space for 16 years. The agency predicts that the satellite will re-enter the atmosphere on Wednesday around 10 a.m. ET as of Sunday afternoon.

The Pentagon said Tuesday the Cosmos 1402 ocean surveillance satellite has begun rapidly increasing its rate of descent in the last 24 hours but no predictions were made about its fate. There still was no indication from U.S. space trackers whether the orbiting two-ton chunk of the satellite containing the nuclear reactor will burn up in the atmosphere or if most of it survives precisely when or where it will hit. There has been growing concern that radioactive fragments from the space derelict might rain down on a land area as happened with an earlier Soviet spy ship that sprayed hot debris on a desolate section of Canada. The satellite and more than 100 pounds of uranium fuel to power its radar and other equipment has begun a more rapid descent toward Earth the closer it has come to the atmosphere. The outer fringe of the atmosphere is about 105 miles up. As of 3:30 p.m. EST Tuesday the satellite had dropped to within 114.6 miles of the Earth’s surface at its lowest altitude and orbited the globe once every 88.4 minutes the Pentagon said today. The orbit dropped about three miles between Sunday and Monday. U.S. intelligence officials who requested anonymity said the satellite could plummet to Earth as early as this weekend although neither the date nor the time could be pinpointed. |

The slayer a slim young 6-footer fired six shots at 20-year-old Eileen Fahey a secretary for the American Physical Society which has a ninth-floor office on Columbia’s campus. Miss Fahey slumped face down on the floor from her desk chair with at least five bullet holes in her chest. The gunman walked out of the office the weapon still smoking in his hand. He took an elevator downstairs and made his way from the building. He stopped just long enough to tell several persons: I just killed a girl. Call the police. The uptown Manhattan campus was awakening to the hurried morning tread of 11700 summer school students as the slayer disappeared. Detectives were at a loss for a motive. They could only suggest that some secret admirer may have slain Miss Fahey in a fit of jealousy. Her brother Frank 18 was shot to death five years ago in a teenage street battle. His slayer went to a reformatory but since has come out on parole. Miss Fahey blue-eyed 5 feet 7 inches and 120 pounds came to work clutching three letters from her boyfriend Ronald Leo a Marine in combat in Korea. Friends described Leo as the only man in her life. She had never even been out with another boy. Crisp in her light summer dress she settled down in the office sipping a glass of orange juice and mooning over the first of the three letters the only one shed opened. Fifteen minutes later she was dead. The other two letters were still unopened on her desk their message forever unknown to her. |

| Boy Who Was Staying At Chicago Migrant Shelter Died Of Sepsis Autopsy Says | Once Empty Marine Base Now Becomes Asiatic City |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The December death of a Venezuelan boy who had stayed at a Chicago migrant shelter was a result of sepsis from a bacterial infection that causes strep throat an autopsy report showed. Jean Carlos Martínez Rivero 5 died from sepsis after a complication of streptococcus pyogenes or Group A Strep according to the Cook County Medical Examiner\s Office.

Today it is a bustling Asiatic city of more than 8000. Camp Pendleton stretching across the coastal hills between Los Angeles and San Diego is filled with Vietnamese signs and loudspeakers giving instructions in their native tongue. The Vietnamese who came here to find new homes are encamped in a green valley with a terrain and climate considerably different from their homeland. The refugee camps are nestled in low brush-covered mountains and cooled by breezes from the Pacific Ocean less than five miles away. The late night fog and damp mornings prevalent in Southern California beach communities cause some discomfort to those used to the steamier environment of their homeland. The children greet the disruption in their lives with smiles and laughter. But the adults caught up in the red tape and the problems of finding a home jobs and some security seem more somber. They find life more complicated than the children most of whom seem to enjoy themselves almost as if they were away at a week-long summer camp. The adults whether they have sponsors or not must fill out lengthy biographical forms for security checks. Many of them don’t know where they will go or what they will do when they get there. Many of the youngsters peer shyly from behind tent flaps gazing at visitors with wondering eyes. Others race merrily through rows of quanset huts in age-old games like follow-the-leader. Most of the children are enveloped in Marine khaki jackets much too big for them but some comfort against the chill. Yellow spring flowers picked by the children brighten many of the quonset huts and tents that serve as temporary homes. The austere quarters shocked some adults many of whom were accustomed to high living in their homeland. |
