| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the best-kept secret about U.S. military aid to Ukraine: Most of the money is being spent here in the United States. That’s right: Funds that lawmakers approve to arm Ukraine are not going directly to Ukraine but are being used stateside to build new weapons or to replace weapons sent to Kyiv from U.S. stockpiles. Of the $68 billion in military and related assistance Congress has approved since Russia invaded Ukraine, almost 90 percent is going to Americans, one analysis found.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you wouldn’t know that from the actions of some U.S. lawmakers. When Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance (R) joined a United Auto Workers picket line in October at the Jeep assembly plant in Toledo, he said he wanted to “show some support for the UAW workers” in his state. Yet he has not shown the same solidarity with the UAW workers in Lima, Ohio, who are churning out Abrams tanks and Stryker combat vehicles for Ukraine thanks to the military aid that Congress has approved. Vance opposes Ukraine aid, as does Rep. ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/29/ukraine-military-aid-american-economy-boost/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/29/ukraine-military-aid-american-economy-boost/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (UPI) — Defense Secretary Robert . McNamara, vigorously defending administration Viet jam policy, said today Americans should be proud of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the “restraint” practiced Dy’ President Johnson in fighting the war.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facing critical questioning by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, McNamara also took sharp issue with what he interpreted as an implication by Chairman J. William Fulbright that the United States was intervening in a civil war.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulbright has been increasing- ly critical of U.S. involvement in South Viet Nam. It was under questioning by Fulbright about the increased commit- ment that McNamara said he felt Americans could be proud of the restraint exercised by the President while many people are urging stepped-up military activity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;¥ulbricht said he agreed that<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pride was justifed in the restraint “such as it is.” He reiterated, however, his con- cern that U.S. aid seems to tie this country to a recipient nation’s defense.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McNamara, testifying in sup- pert of the administration’s $917 million military aid request, said only military treaties contain such an obliga- tion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulbright subsequently asked whether defense treaties author- ize intervention in civil wars. Before he finished the question, McNamara interrupted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said “I strongly dissent” from what he felt was an implication by Fulbright that the Viet Nam conflict was ‘basically an internal one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McNamara said it was a<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “flagrant case of outside aggression and intervention.” Under questioning by Sen. John Sparkman, D-Ala., he went on to cite numbers and dates of infiltration by Commu- nist troops from North Viet Nam into South Viet Nam. McNamara testified _ that there now are about 325,000 American servicemen in South- east Asia—including 240,000 in South Viet Nam. And he said under questioning that number could be “substantially” expand- ed without calling up reservists. Defending the military aid request—part of the administra- tion’s over-all $3.39 _ billion foreign aid proposal under consideration by the committee —McNamara said it would be irrational to spend $50 billion a year on American armed forces<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gea AICNAMARA~-Page *  |
