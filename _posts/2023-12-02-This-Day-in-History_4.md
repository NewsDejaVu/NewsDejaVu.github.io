| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demise of political party bosses and the smoke-filled rooms in which they operated was heralded a long time ago as an important step toward handing more power over the selection of presidential nominees to ordinary citizens. Who would have thought then that billionaires would seek to become the new bosses of American politics?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Super-wealthy individuals receive outsize attention in presidential politics. And virtually every prospective candidate wants the support of a well-funded super PAC and the vocal backing of the mega rich. The defection of a disenchanted billionaire is treated as bad news for any candidate. But what difference does all this make?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last week, Americans for Prosperity, part of the political network of billionaire industrialist Charles Koch, endorsed Nikki Haley in her bid to become the Republican nominee. The endorsement was heralded as a major coup for the former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina governor, who has been gaining in the polls.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/02/billionaires-presidential-politics-power/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/02/billionaires-presidential-politics-power/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Nixon says he will not endorse anyone for the 1976 Re- publican presidential nomination ‘“‘until they have been in the field of battle"’ in the primary elections that year.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nixon told a news conference Wednesday that history teaches that some aspiring senators and governors “can't hit the big league pitching’ they'll face in a presidential campaign.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I would like to see how these various potential candidates handle themselves in pri- maries before making any decision in regard to who should be candidate,”’ he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President gave his views after being asked if he stood behind his temporary opposi- tion to Sen. Charles H. Percy of Dlinois as a possible GOP standard bearer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acknowledging he once opposed Percy because of what he described as a misunder- standing, Nixon said the senator has a right to seek the presidency if he desires, as do “several governors or former governors who might be a candidate, as well as the mayor of Indianapolis ( Richard Lugar) or a number of senators and one or two House members.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conspicuously absent from Nixon's list was Vice President Spiro T. Agnew. A White House aide said this had no significance because Nixon was talking off the cuff. Included, as an ambitious former governor, was John D. Connally, who often has been described as the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President's favorite for the nomination.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeming relaxed as he faced reporters in the White House press center, Nixon said he has never asked Agnew to resign because of the bribe-taking allegations he faces and defended as “altogether proper’’ Agnew’s vow not to resign even if indicted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questioned about troubles of his own, Nixon restated his refusal to turn over White House tapes to Watergate investigators. And regarding federal spending on his California and Florida estates, Nixon declared, ‘‘I think full statements have been made over and over again on this.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another topic, Nixon sympathized with Ausiria’s “very difficult position’ when faced by Arab terrorists holding hostages.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he expressed hope that Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky ‘‘would reconsider his position, even though I know he has even lately reiterated it.’’ Kreisky agreed to shut down transient facilities in Austria for Jewish emigrants from the Soviet Union bound for Israel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanitarian considerations aside, Nixon said, ‘“‘we simply cannot have governments, small or large, give in to international black- mail by terrorist groups."’ -<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nixon opened the news conference, his third in six weeks, by announcing that Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger will visit Peking on Oct. 26-29 and stop in Japan during the trip.  |
