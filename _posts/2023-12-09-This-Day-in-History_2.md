| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COLUMBUS, Ohio — For much of the rainy MLS Cup at the Columbus Crew’s gold-splashed palace, there was a greater sense of coronation than tension. The hungry hosts scored twice in the first half Saturday, and with Los Angeles FC flashing few of the elements that had positioned it for a possible repeat championship, the Crew seemed certain to raise the trophy for a third time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But finals are almost never this easy, and when the final whistle broke a tension-cooked stretch run unfurling in heavy rain, the Crew and its record crowd at Lower.com Field celebrated a 2-1 thriller.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I cried like a baby,” said Cucho Hernández, the game MVP.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Columbus, an MLS founding member, won the title for the second time in four seasons while denying LAFC’s attempt to become the first repeat champion since the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2011-12.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hernández and Yaw Yeboah scored four minutes apart, and Columbus survived a whirlwind finish, including Dénis Bouanga’s 74th-minute goal and seven minutes of stoppage  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/09/mls-cup-columbus-crew-lafc/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/09/mls-cup-columbus-crew-lafc/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHICAGO—There’s an epidemic sweeping the city, but no one’s seeking a cure. It’s Cubs fever, and thousands of pennant-hungry fans took to the streets to celebrate their team’s first championship in 39 years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 10,000 screaming, singing people rushed to the gates of Wrigley Field, home of the long-suffering Cubs, after Monday night’s 4-1 victo- ry over the Pittsburgh Pirates locked up the Na- tional League East crown. The revelers, many with beer and champagne glistening in their hair, danced and ‘chanted, ‘‘We’re No. 1! We’re No. 1!”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They climbed billboards, stoplights and the outer walls of the ancient stadium famous for its lack of lights. They leaned on horns, set off fireworks and waved Cubs pennants that vendors were selling at a rate of 100 per hour.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were only 50 officers assigned to control the crowds, said Lt. Patrick Kelly. But police re- ported no arrests.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar patrons clogged Division and Rush streets in a wild celebration. Nearly 1,000 revelers, including Gov. James R. Thompson, jammed the Ultimate Sports Bar.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I thought I’d be dead before I ever saw some- thing like this,’’ said Bert Campbell,.a Cubs fan since 1950. ‘‘I cried when the Cubs won tonight. Tears of joy.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gayle Lieberman, 32, a speech therapist, stopped by Murphy’s Bleachers after work. She left the bar drenched with champagne.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ve waited so long for this I can hardly com-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plain,’’ she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was even a faint cheer on the city’s South Side where the final out of the Cubs game was flashed on the big screen at Comiskey Park, home of the Chicago White Sox, the city’s American League franchise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Stadium, hundreds of Cubs fans danced in the aisles, waved banners and celebrated.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came by car and bus and plane—many on the spur of the moment—to hoist banners and beers in boosting a team that has had nothing to celebrate since 1945.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m buying beer for the whole city of Pitts- burgh,’’ Cubs manager Jim Frey yelled in the Chi- cago dressing room. :<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I wish we could have done it in front of our fans,’’ Frey said after Cubs ace pitcher Rick Sut- cliffe hurled a two-hitter for his 14th straight victo- ry before the crowd of 5,472 people.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to WGN television, the Chicago satellite super station, Cubs fans in an estimated 18.6 million homes and businesses across the Western Hemis- phere could witness the win.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cubs must now play the National League West champion San Diego Padres for the league championship. :<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winner advances to the World Series to take on the American League pennant winner for the bragging rights to major league baseball. The last time a Cubs team did that was in 1945, in the shadow of World War II—and the last time they won the Series was before World War I, in 1908.  |
