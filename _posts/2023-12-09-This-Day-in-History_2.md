LOUIS (AP) — Moments after the last out of the 1982 World Series, the streets of St. Louis foamed with fans toasting the world champion Cardinals with beer. as fireworks bloomed overhead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Milwaukee, Brewer fans didn’t cry in their beer over Wednesday night's 6-3 less, but showed pride that their team had made it to the fall classic:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the contest that pitted one major brewing city against another in what St. Louis Mayor Vincent Schoenmehl called “The World Beeries,”” thousands of fans toasted their Redbirds in the streets. It ap- peared that a new slogan would be needed for the city that once boasted it was “First in shoes, first in booze and last in the American League,” a reference to the old St. Louis Browns.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You just have to have patience,” said Rick Kragnes. a bus driver with<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about 30 dancing fans on the roof of his vehicle. “I ain’t going nowhere. I didn't realize what I was getting into until it was too late.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kiener Plaza, a downtown park, two spotlighted hot-air balloons loomed like giant mushrooms under a fireworks display that marked the Cardinals’ ninth world championship.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers were out in force around the stadium, but barricades proved useless against the tens of thousands of fans.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite warnings from the stadium’s public address announcer in the game's final inning that it was illegal to go onto the field, hundreds poured on to the artificial turf at the final out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police with dogs were quickly outnumbered and could make only a feeble attempt to control the crowd. Mounted police also stood by as<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people covered the infield and most of the outfield.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a noisy fireworks display, police began to herd the fans toward the: center field exit, revealing a playing surface scarred by divots and covered with debris.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August A. Busch Jr., the 83-year- old owner of the Cardinals, was close to tears as he congratulated his players and manager Whitey Herzog. Busch had said earlier this year that all he still required out of life was another world championship for his team, yet on Wednesday night he appeared overwhelmed by its reality.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is the greatest one of my life,’ Busch said. “The other ones were all good, but this might he my last one. And the last is always the best.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a disco near the stadium, a woman in a black bikini took pity on the Brewers fans and dedicated a song lo them: ‘‘Heartache Tonight.”  |
