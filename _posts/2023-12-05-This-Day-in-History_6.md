The disgraced ex-congressman debuted Monday on Cameo, the video-sharing platform where users can commission a personalized message from actors, athletes and varying grades of celebrities.

He adds that their affair was by mutual consent. ~ “T don’t: think 30,” says Geeta on whether it will hurt her father’s career. “He was legally separated. He is human like everyone else and I think most people realize this. He. dido’t hire her for that purpose. He doesn't work that way,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My mother is fine.

She has no com- ment, She feels like 1 do, complete confidence in Dad."”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship with Miss Ray has generated banner headlines in newspapers in Hays’ eight-county Obio district and in neighboring Wheeling, W.Va. Most constituents say his political career might be hurt-but not enough to cost him re- election.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh.

But Mr. Hays has done a lot of good for a lot of small men in the community, ordinary persons. If someone needs a little help he gives it to them. . -<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A lot of men here are coal miners and sometimes they have trouble getting their black lung benefits. People say that when they write Mr. Hays, whether he is able to help them or not, they always get an answer.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' Hays, 65, left the white frame home on Wood Street after divore- ing Martha, and was married April Hto Pat Peak,- manager of his office in nearby St. Clairsville.
