| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospect of a full-scale war between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia terrifies people on both sides of the border but some see it as an inevitable fallout from Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza. Such a war could be the most destructive either side has ever experienced. Israel and Hezbollah each have lessons from their last war in 2006 a monthlong conflict that ended in a draw. They’ve also had four months to prepare for another war even as the United State ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-war-preparedness-civilians-military-aafd7a0048dceb810456b93ceecf543c)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official Moscow and Peking exchanged thousands of threatening words today but their crisis came home best in four words from one worried man: ‘Bad very very bad.”’ The Soviet Unions top ideological writers let loose a 2000 - word editorial barrage in Pravda the Soviet Communist party paper that condemned Mao Tse - tung as a traitor warmonger and a failure. Radio Peking said essentially the same thing of the Kremlin and added its armed forces were ‘preparing for a war.”’ A Soviet Foreign Office spokesman summed up _ the situation more bluntly Friday night with the comment that diplomatic relations in the wake of the Ussuri River border battle are ‘‘bad very very bad through no fault of ours.”’ He said the Soviet Embassy in Peking is ‘‘under siege in the full sense of the word by groups of hooligans.’’ Chinese broadcasts boast repeatedly that it is but foreign newsmen there Say demonstrations outside it have abated. Tens of thousands of Muscovites marched past the Chinese Embassy Friday shortly before the Soviet Foreign Ministry charged publicly Chinese troops had mutilated wounded Soviet troops in Sunday’s clash and shot down their peace emissarys point - blank. The demonstrators hurled ink pots beer bottles and chunks of ice through most of the 100 embassy windows. Tass originally estimated the size of the crowd at about 50000. Witnesses put the figure as high as 250000. Peking has claimed that 150 million Chinese have demonstrated nationwide against the Soviets. Peking Radios propaganda barrage against the Kremlin today said the Chinese army navy and air force were ‘‘preparing for a war. If the treacherous Soviet revisionist clique dares to continue invasion into China we will terminate all such efforts. . .”’ The Pravda editorial said the Chinese deliberately attacked the Soviet outpost in hopes that ‘‘by fanning up anti - Soviet hysteria and chauvinistic frenzy”’ it could cover up the failure of Mao’s policies at home and his attempts to split the international Communist bloc away from Soviet leadership. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weve all been there. Youre in a parking lot looking for a spot but you can’t find a single space. You circle around hoping for someone to leave but no luck. You start to feel annoyed and stressed. Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a better way to park your car? Well there is. Meet Parkie the parking robot that could mean the end of fighting for a parking space in the future. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/could-parking-robot-mean-end-fighting-for-parking-space)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHICAGO (AP)—Donald Bruns a paraplegic Navy veteran who drives his car about 45 miles daily to the Loop to attend classes at a broadcasting school may have to quit—unless he can find a place to park his car. Bruns who is learning to be a radio announcer has to find a parking place in the block where the school is located. He can't go to school if he has to park across the street from the school or one or two blocks away. He can't get over curbs in his wheel chair. Bruns who is 26 married and the father of a son and daughter has been parking his car in a garage in the same block as the school for five weeks. But he said the garage manager told him Tuesday he couldn’t leave it there any more because the special hand controls for paraplegics constitute a special risk. He was told that a garage attendant might push the wrong knot and smash another car. “It's not true that hand controls make a car dangerous" Bruns said. “My car operates like any other car except that I has some extra equipment. My wife drives it all the time.” Bruns has been a paraplegic since 1955 when he was in an accident in the Navy. He lives in suburban Cary where he is an assistant director of civil defense and for the last two years was director of the community's Red Cross fund drive. |

| Across America Clean Energy Plants Are Being Banned Faster Than They're Being Built | High Court Rules States May Bar Nuclear Plants |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across America’s power grid there’s a growing gap between what we need and what we’ll allow. As the planet warms and climate disasters grow more costly the U.S. has set a target to reach 100% clean energy by 2035 a goal that depends on building large-scale solar and wind power. A nationwide analysis by USA TODAY shows local governments are banning green energy faster than they’re building it. At least 15% of counties in the U.S. have effectively halted new utility-scale wind solar or bot ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/02/04/us-counties-ban-renewable-energy-plants/71841063007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court has given states sweeping powers to halt nuclear power plant construction as long as it is done to protect economic interests. In a 9-0 decision Wednesday the justices held states using traditional power to regulate utilities may act to protect their citizens against utility rate increases stemming from costly nuclear power plant construction. The ruling considered a setback to the nuclear industry upheld a California moratorium on new atomic reactor construction pending development of a permanent storage system for high-level radioactive waste. But the court's ruling went beyond the politically sensitive issue of waste disposal and cleared the way for states to veto nuclear power development within their borders if they can justify it on economic grounds. The court specifically said a state may not take such action out of safety concerns which are the federal government's responsibility. Congress has left sufficient authority in the states to allow development of nuclear power to be slowed or even stopped for economic reasons Justice Byron White wrote for the court. Laurence Tribe who argued the case for the California Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission said the ruling is especially important because states have the power to completely reject economic dependence on nuclear plants. Nuclear industry representatives insisted the ruling does not affect plants currently under construction or in operation. But Tribe said the court's reasoning could apply to an ongoing plant. If a state decides it's too costly and uncertain a source of electricity there might be other issues raised but the court makes it quite clear it's the states' decision. Donald Winston a spokesman for the Atomic Industrial Forum said It tells the states that they have the right to pass a law like this provided it involves the economics of the plant. The net effect of this decision is minimal at least for the short term because the (U.S. nuclear) industry is dead and decaying said Edward Merrow the director of the energy policy programs office for the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica Calif. |

| Groundhogs Are More Than Weather Predictors: Here Are Some Lesser Known Facts About Them | Punxsutawney Phil The Peerless Prognosticator |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Friday Punxsutawney Phil and other less-famous groundhogs across the nation will emerge from their dens to determine whether six more weeks of winter are in store. The mammals prognostications arent likely to settle the question of our future weather *ahem* beyond a shadow of a doubt. But dont blame the groundhogs: Research indicates they emerge in February not to see their shadow but to well get frisky. If you didnt know that about the large squirrel which is the most widespread ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/01/groundhog-day-february-shadow-facts/72356207007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punxsutawney Phil the underground oracle named for this town saw his shadow when he peered from his groundhog burrow this morning and tradition says that means six more weeks of the calamitous Winter of 82. Charles M. Erhard president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club roused the slumbering rodent from his electrically heated burrow. The long-range forecast issued by the National Weather Service concurred with Phils findings in a year that has seen record cold temperatures nationwide. The National Meteorological Center checked with Uncle Phil before they put out their extended forecast and they agree with his prognosis said meteorologist Frank Lucadamo in Pittsburgh. According to myth and legend spring would have been right around the corner if Phil had not seen his shadow. The rodent has predicted an extended winter every year but two since 1960. Similar events were planned across the state in Quarryville Pa. and Sun Prairie Wis. But townspeople here insist that Phil who has been making forecasts since 1877 is a peerless prognosticator. The groundhog lives in a glass-enclosed pen with his mate Phyllis in the center of town. They eat a diet recommended by a zookeeper of dry dog food animal vitamins apples and carrots. Phil is put into his burrow on Gobblers Knob just before the big event on Groundhog Day. There is no scientific evidence that any animal can forecast the weather. And the National Geographic Society once pointed out that groundhogs normally hibernate until March not early February. But this town of 7792 located 80 miles north of Pittsburgh and named by the Delaware Indians for a vicious species of black flies that once thrived here has cultivated international fame by promoting a myth that can be traced back to ancient Scotland. To mark the occasion the local high school crowns a groundhog king and queen. And the town honors its man and woman of the year at a Groundhog Day banquet held after Phils prediction which is duly recorded annually in the Congressional Record. Its a fun event. Its the kind of holiday that if it didnt exist wed have to invent it. What else would you do on Feb. 2? said Elaine Light a historian and former reporter who has written two books about Punxsutawney and Groundhog Day. Besides Punxsutawney Phil is as accurate as any television weatherman and he doesnt make bad jokes. He just says what he has to say and goes back to sleep she said. |
