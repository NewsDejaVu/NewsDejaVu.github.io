| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospect of a full-scale war between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia terrifies people on both sides of the border but some see it as an inevitable fallout from Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza. Such a war could be the most destructive either side has ever experienced. Israel and Hezbollah each have lessons from their last war in 2006 a monthlong conflict that ended in a draw. They’ve also had four months to prepare for another war even as the United State ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-war-preparedness-civilians-military-aafd7a0048dceb810456b93ceecf543c)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official Moscow and Peking exchanged thousands of threatening words today but their crisis came home best in four words from one worried man: ‘Bad very very bad.”’ The Soviet Unions top ideological writers let loose a 2000 - word editorial barrage in Pravda the Soviet Communist party paper that condemned Mao Tse - tung as a traitor warmonger and a failure. Radio Peking said essentially the same thing of the Kremlin and added its armed forces were ‘preparing for a war.”’ A Soviet Foreign Office spokesman summed up _ the situation more bluntly Friday night with the comment that diplomatic relations in the wake of the Ussuri River border battle are ‘‘bad very very bad through no fault of ours.”’ He said the Soviet Embassy in Peking is ‘‘under siege in the full sense of the word by groups of hooligans.’’ Chinese broadcasts boast repeatedly that it is but foreign newsmen there Say demonstrations outside it have abated. Tens of thousands of Muscovites marched past the Chinese Embassy Friday shortly before the Soviet Foreign Ministry charged publicly Chinese troops had mutilated wounded Soviet troops in Sunday’s clash and shot down their peace emissarys point - blank. The demonstrators hurled ink pots beer bottles and chunks of ice through most of the 100 embassy windows. Tass originally estimated the size of the crowd at about 50000. Witnesses put the figure as high as 250000. Peking has claimed that 150 million Chinese have demonstrated nationwide against the Soviets. Peking Radios propaganda barrage against the Kremlin today said the Chinese army navy and air force were ‘‘preparing for a war. If the treacherous Soviet revisionist clique dares to continue invasion into China we will terminate all such efforts. . .”’ The Pravda editorial said the Chinese deliberately attacked the Soviet outpost in hopes that ‘‘by fanning up anti - Soviet hysteria and chauvinistic frenzy”’ it could cover up the failure of Mao’s policies at home and his attempts to split the international Communist bloc away from Soviet leadership. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weve all been there. Youre in a parking lot looking for a spot but you can’t find a single space. You circle around hoping for someone to leave but no luck. You start to feel annoyed and stressed. Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a better way to park your car? Well there is. Meet Parkie the parking robot that could mean the end of fighting for a parking space in the future. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/could-parking-robot-mean-end-fighting-for-parking-space)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHICAGO (AP)—Donald Bruns a paraplegic Navy veteran who drives his car about 45 miles daily to the Loop to attend classes at a broadcasting school may have to quit—unless he can find a place to park his car. Bruns who is learning to be a radio announcer has to find a parking place in the block where the school is located. He can't go to school if he has to park across the street from the school or one or two blocks away. He can't get over curbs in his wheel chair. Bruns who is 26 married and the father of a son and daughter has been parking his car in a garage in the same block as the school for five weeks. But he said the garage manager told him Tuesday he couldn’t leave it there any more because the special hand controls for paraplegics constitute a special risk. He was told that a garage attendant might push the wrong knot and smash another car. “It's not true that hand controls make a car dangerous" Bruns said. “My car operates like any other car except that I has some extra equipment. My wife drives it all the time.” Bruns has been a paraplegic since 1955 when he was in an accident in the Navy. He lives in suburban Cary where he is an assistant director of civil defense and for the last two years was director of the community's Red Cross fund drive. |
