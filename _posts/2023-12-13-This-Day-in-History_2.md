| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Kate Cox, whose fetus had a fatal condition, did not qualify for an abortion in Texas: not after four emergency room visits, elevated vital signs, risks of a uterine rupture and with her ability to have more children in jeopardy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Texas Supreme Court’s rejection of the mother of two’s request for an exception under the state’s restrictive ban has laid bare the high threshold women in many states must meet to get the procedure: pregnancy complications that pose life-threatening danger to the mother.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“These laws reflect the policy choice that the Legislature has made, and the courts must respect that choice,” the court’s nine Republican justices said in their ruling late Monday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state’s Republican attorney general had for a week argued that Cox did not meet the standard for an exception, despite appeals from her attorneys that her health was deteriorating. Hours before the order came down, Cox’s attorney said she could no longer wait for the procedure and h ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/e85664b2ab76bcb689b1b91913d3e33e](https://apnews.com/e85664b2ab76bcb689b1b91913d3e33e) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Supreme Court decision that allows abortions on demand in early stages of pregnancy is being applauded by women’s rights advocates but criticized by Roman Catholic churchmen as a “tragedy” and “catastrophe” for the nation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a 7-2 vote, the Supreme Court Monday struck down state laws that ' prohibit abortions during the first three months of a pregnancy. That decision, the court ruled, is up to the woman and her physician.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second three months, or until a fetus has reached a stage of “viability” —when it could be born and live —the state may regulate but not forbid an abortion. The decision allows states to regulate the conditions of abortion, such as who may perform them and what kinds of facilities should be required.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this ‘viability’ stage— reached ‘at 6 or 7 months—a state may forbid abortions except “when it is necessary to preserve the health or life or the mother.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority ruling, by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, held that rights of per- sonal property under the 4th Amemdment are “broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justices Byron R. White and William H. Rehnquist dissented, claiming the Majority was exercising raw judicial power to put “the convenience, whim or caprice of the putative mother” above the interests of the state and society.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision will sharply alter the application of antiabortion laws of 46 states. It held uriconstitutional —as ap- plied —a Texas law limiting abortions to cases where the mother’s life was at Stake and a Georgia law allowing three grounds for abortion, one of them cases<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;< of rape, Twnety-nine other states have  lbws® stiniiar- to Texas’ aiid 15 thers have laws similar to Geofgia’s. °""'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rep. Bella Abzug, D-N.Y,, said, “This _-is an historic and giant step toward the recognition of the rights of women tc control their own bodies and to have abortions by choice under the con- stitutional right to privacy.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said the “next step” must be enactment of a national law prohibiting any restriction on abortion at any time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilma Scott Heidi, president of the National Organization of Women (NOW), said most of the decision was “good” but that it should have given the woman the right to decide rather than her doctor. She said the decision should not have allowed states to limit abortion practitioners to doctors, adding “We<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think paraprofessionals ean do it.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardinal John Krol of Philadelphia president of the National Conference o! Catholic Bishops, said the decision ‘i an unspeakable tragedy for this<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ nation.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It is hard to think of any decision ir - the 200 years of our history which ha: had more disastrous implications fo our stability as a civilized society ... Th child in the womb has the right to life i already possesses, and this is a right nc court has authority to deny,” Cardina Krol said,  |
