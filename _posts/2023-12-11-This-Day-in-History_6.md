(AP) — Arthur H. Bremer, the onetime photography student charged with shooting Democratic presi- déntial candidate George C. Wallace, is de- scribed as a quiet but confident loner.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture drawn by relatives, friends and acquaintances of the man who is ac- cused of gunning down Wallace and three others at a Maryland shopping center Mon- day is that of a youth who kept his opin- ions to himself, developed few friendships and was something of a puzzle even to his family.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brémer, 21, is being held in lieu of $200,000 bond in Maryland, under federal charges of assaulting a candidate for pub- lic office and a federal officer and under State charges of assault with intent to kill.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although acquaintances, including class- mates in his college photography class, said they were not aware of political inter- ests or activity on the part of the blond young man with close-cropped hair, effects found in his Milwaukee apartment Monday night indicated otherwise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Among the items in the West Side apart- ment were a Confederate flag and news- paper clippings ahaut Wailace’s campaign, some dating to 1968 when Wallace staged a third-party effort.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He must have been for George Wall- ace, because he had a Wallace sticker<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suspect is taken away Prisoner (in white shirt) is taken from federal court at Baltimore after being charged in shooting of ‘Wallace. (UPI Photo)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;across the door,’’ said Stephen Wasche, 17, a neighbor in the apartment house. Bremer moved into the apartment from<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his family’s South Side home last fall. Neighbors said he dropped from sight about a month ago.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bremer’s truck driver father, William, 58, Said his son had ‘never mentioned any- thing political,’ but he said he had learned that his son was a ‘‘dues-paying member of the 12th Ward Democratic unit.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notebooks found in the apartment in- cluded one with the words ‘‘Cheer up, Os- wald”’ in large print. Then, in smaller print, were the words ‘“‘white collar con- servative ... middle class Republican ... suburbanite robot.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of Bremer’s  family--whe hadn’t seen him since he moved to the apartment in October—described him as “shy and timid,’ and they expressed dis- belief that he could have been involved in the shooting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We could never talk to him,” said a younger brother, Roger, 18 ‘We never knew much about him.” Roger said his mother, Sylvia, 57, had tried to visit Ar- thur at the apartment but he ‘‘slammed the door in her face.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the items found in the apartment were two boxes of shells—one containing 21 .38-ealiber shells, the other 23 9mm car- tridges—and seven targets, as well as some gun magazines.  |
