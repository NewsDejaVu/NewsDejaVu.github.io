Four U.S. Navy ships dispatched by President Ford from bases in the Far East steamed toward South Vietnam to evacuate refugees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Saigon, the Viet Cong Provisional Revolutionary Government said ‘‘all boats and planes, from whatever country, must ask permission before entering PRG territorial waters.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two U.S. ships, the Pioneer Commander and Pioneer Contender, loaded refugees at Da Nang Sunday and today, then sailed south to Cam Ranh Bay, where refugee camps have been set<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up.  |
