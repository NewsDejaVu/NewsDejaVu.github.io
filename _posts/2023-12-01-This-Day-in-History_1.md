| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (AP) — The irreverent feminist website Jezebel is making a comeback less than a month after it was shut down.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paste Magazine, a digital pop culture publication based in Atlanta, announced Wednesday that it was buying Jezebel.com from G/O Media, which closed it and laid off its staff earlier this month.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jezebel’s “acquisition means that the critical information and content that Jezebel readers have come to rely on will live on,” Paste Founder and Editor-in-Chief Josh Jackson said in a prepared statement. “Jezebel’s unique voice and commitment to storytelling make it a perfect addition to our portfolio.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G/0 Media said it was shutting down Jezebel after trying unsuccessfully for months to find a buyer for the site, which was first launched in 2007 by Gawker Media and swiftly gained an impassioned following with its combination of searing commentary on gender politics and edgy pop culture coverage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson told The Associated Press via email that Paste became interested in bu ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/jezebel-paste-magazine-feminist-publishing-72c5a8f168a5444b0904c41cf8d8abd0](https://apnews.com/article/jezebel-paste-magazine-feminist-publishing-72c5a8f168a5444b0904c41cf8d8abd0) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK, March 1. (P) — The Police Gazette, as much a part of yesterday's barbershop as the squirt-bottle, has failed to respond to the massage of its creditors, It lies today in a court of bankruptcy, as dead as clipped hair on the lineogumed floor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When pictures of ladies in tights were considered daring, and photographs of mustachioec<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   pugilists with massive arms folded proudly across enormous. chests ‘aroused great reader enthusiasm, th ePolice Gazette had its heyday. Now that tights are antique and mustaches little more than hairy -breves accenting masculine _ lips, the pink-papered periodical has found itself without a sufficient following.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, its creditors claim, the Police Gazette had its heyday $100,000, with expenses $40,000 greater. Conferences of creditors<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; failed of satisfactory conelusions. Yesterday the Irving Trust Com- pany was appointed receiver in bankruptcy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The megazine, when taking the trade at top stride, was consider- ed somewhat daring, with its pic- tures of statuesque stage sirens given to substantial contours; yet from its beginning it was the in- sistence of the Richard K. Fox Publishing company (its publish-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ers) that the Police Gazette be kept clean in text and picture.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this endeavor the publishers were -successful. Scandal and   malicious gossip were alien to its<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pale pink pages. Innuendo was ‘not tolerated. The only excuse for  @ prevalent belief that the mag-  azine was over-emphatic in its ap-   peal were the pictured beauties of burlesque, postured in attire which —-in the more far-away “places— was regarded as extremely desh-   abille.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i  |
