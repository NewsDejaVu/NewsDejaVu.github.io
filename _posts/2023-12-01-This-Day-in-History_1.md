| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel’s war with Hamas erupted again Friday, as airstrikes hit houses and buildings in the Gaza Strip minutes after a weeklong truce expired. Health authorities in the besieged territory reported dozens of Palestinians killed and Israel dropped leaflets over Gaza City and southern parts of the enclave, urging civilians to flee to avoid the fighting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Militants in Gaza resumed firing rockets into Israel, and fighting broke out between Israel and Hezbollah militants operating along its northern border with Lebanon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resumption of the war threatens to compound the suffering in Gaza. Some 2 million people -- almost its entire population -- are crammed into the territory’s south, where Israel urged people to relocate at the war’s start and has since vowed to extend its ground assault.

A_ one-sentence<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statement said the bombing operations were again carried out at the request of the Phnom Penh government.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lt. Col. Le Trung Hien, spokesman for the Saigon command, said Friday Commu- nist troops had violated the cease-fire 5,435 times since the truce took effect. He said in that time, 8,744 Communists have been killed and another 195 taken captive; Saigon forces lost 1,571 killed, 7,522 wounded and 1,068 missing; and civilian casualties total 119 killed, 555 wounded and 672 abducted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaylor said military sources told him CIA troops and the Communists met each other recently just outside the former district capital of Muong Phalane in central Laos. The sources said the two sides exchanged congratulations that neither had violated the cease- fire and worked out a system to keep in touch in case fighting breaks out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In north Laos, the sources told Kaylor, units of  pro- government troops recruited from Thailand reported they were approached under a truce flag by North Vietnamese officers who spoke with them in Thai. They exchanged gifts of cigaretes and candy, indulged in small talks about the hardships of war and promised to avoid further fighting.  |
