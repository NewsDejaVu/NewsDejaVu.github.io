| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;correction A previous version of this article as well as a photo caption that appeared on The Washington Post’s homepage incorrectly said that Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) was one of the Republican lawmakers who walked out of a classified briefing about funding for Ukraine. He was not part of that group. The article has been corrected. Senators began blaming each other Tuesday for the looming potential failure to provide additional aid to Ukraine as fragile negotiations over a national security package continued to break down amid Republican demands for far-reaching immigration restrictions.

John F. Kennedy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kennedy, the Democratic presi- dential: nominee, has run into trou- ble from a coalition of Republi- cans and Southern Democrats in his efforts to produce legislation aimed at crossing the ‘‘new fron- tier’’ he has been talking about.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partly because of ominous world events, Eisenhower is racking up some gains in the international field.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the coalition is giving him some things in the domestic area that Vice Pnesident Richard M. Nixon, the GOP presidential nom- inee, can talk about in the cam- paign.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eisenhower’s batting average on the 21-point program he resubmit- ted to the post-convention session apparently will be a respectable .334, Kennedy may hit only .250<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jon four major measures he hoped ‘ito get passed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eisenhower got practical- ily everything he asked for when the Senate passed a $3,989,054,000 \foreign aid bill Wednesday. Even jif disturbances in the Congo and Cuba contributed to this result, it ‘came in a field dear to Ejisen- hower’s heart.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way toward final action is a bill to provide medical care on a federal-state matching basis. This is essentially the Eisenhower formula as opposed to the Senate- rejected Kennedy plan to finance such a program through Social ‘Security taxes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Congress finally passes a ‘minimum wage bill, it probably will fit the Eisenhower adminis- tration pattern more closely than Kennedy’s broader bill providing a higher minimum and extending coverage to more persons.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President got senate ap- proval of the antarctic treaty and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appears likely to get congressional authorization for a 600-million-dol- lar Latin American aid program.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His proposal to put a food-for- peace plan before the United Na- tions — which the Democrats say they proposed first—is before the Senate Foreign Relations Commit- tee with indications that it will get quick action.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 100-million-dollar increase in the mutual security contingent fund was approved by the Senate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the congres- sional session has been a political disappointment thus far for Ken- nedy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid a filibuster which might have tied the Senate in knots, the Democratic nominee joined in a vote to kill a hastily produced administration civil rights bill. :<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lost his fight for the kind of  a medical care bill he wanted and condemned the measure passed by the Senate as inadequate.  |
