| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;correction A previous version of this article as well as a photo caption that appeared on The Washington Post’s homepage incorrectly said that Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) was one of the Republican lawmakers who walked out of a classified briefing about funding for Ukraine. He was not part of that group. The article has been corrected. Senators began blaming each other Tuesday for the looming potential failure to provide additional aid to Ukraine as fragile negotiations over a national security package continued to break down amid Republican demands for far-reaching immigration restrictions.

ArrowRight “If funding for Ukraine fails, the failure will solely be on the Republican Party,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E.

Ralph Gwinn ( R.. N.

For military aid to for- ‘eign nations, it would have authorized an appropriation of   $1,000,000,000.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote came after Represent- ative Rankin (D., Miss.) asserved that “if every man in this House<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; voted his honest convictions,” the entire foreign aid program would be killed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~ Rankin said the nation could spend its money more wisely on Air Force expansion and atom bomb production than by “pour- ing it into the rat holes of Europe.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, Representative Cox (D.. Ga.) said persons who are or were ‘‘Soviet sympathizers” might have a hand in administer- ing the recovery program. Cox ‘nae’ revisions to limit ERP per- isonnel to “those who believe in and support our American sys- tem of society and government.”   The vote on the Gwinn amend- ment made it clear that the for- eign affairs committee, author of the omnibus aid measure, was in complete contral in the House and lwould drive through, probably Wednesday, a bill substantially identical to the one the committee wrote more than a week ago.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centinued om Page Twe  |
