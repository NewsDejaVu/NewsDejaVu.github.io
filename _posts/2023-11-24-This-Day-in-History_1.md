AP) — “It is love that makes all the difference.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that age - old theme, Joseph A, Flaherty, 39, a con- victed robber and rapist, and a Canadian girl base their pleas for his freedom from state prison so they can marry.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Flaherty and Fran McKearney, 33, whose love the former public enemy said changed his life, await a de- cision from the parole board. The board has the appeal un- der advisement and is expect- ed to give Flaherty his an- swer in about two weeks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘T was fortunate enough to have some help — help that I had needed all my life,” Flaherty told the board Fri- day. ‘‘That was the love of a very wonderful girl.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strapping convict, whose long criminal record in Massachusetts was climaxed with leadership of the Cherry Hill riot at the old state<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prison in Charlestown in 1955, told the board of his loveless childhood and his beginnings in crime.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It seems I couldn't project into other people and _ that was the reason I was able to commit these crimes,’’ Fla- herty said. ‘‘I need this break desperately.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  DARK - HAIRED, _ green- eyed Miss McKearney, who announced her engagement to Flaherty in January, _ said, “I have no qualms or fears.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss McKearney, formerly of Ft. St. John, B. C., and now living in Somerville, a Boston suburb, read of Fla- herty’s part in the riot while she was working for the Ca- nadian army in the Canadian Yukon. She sent him a Christ- mas card.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They corresponded and ro- mance blossomed.   When she appeared before the board, seven years after the correspondence began,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she carried a bundle contain- ing 2,000 letters the convict had written her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“T have seen him once a week and have written him every day since 1956. I feel he has changed = radically,’’ she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing jewelry made by Flaherty, Miss McKearney told the board in a ‘soft voice: ‘‘We would like to be married as soon as possible. Each additional year in pris- on makes it harder for us to establish a new life, Neither of us is getting any younger; he’s almost 40 and I’m 33. We would like very much to have a family.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew Flaherty is_ the divorced father of two, she said, and she would be willing to have Flaherty contribute to the support of the children, who are being raised by a grandmother.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flaherty is serving a 35-to 47- year sentence and would be eligible for parole in 1964.  |
