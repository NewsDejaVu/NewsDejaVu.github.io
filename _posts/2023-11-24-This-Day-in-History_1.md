| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas on Friday released 24 hostages it held captive in Gaza for weeks, and Israel freed 39 Palestinians from prison in the first stage of a swap under a four-day cease-fire that offered a small glimmer of relief to both sides.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel — wrenched by the abduction of nearly 240 people in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war — cheered as 13 Israeli women and children emerged free from Gaza. Most were in their 70s or 80s, and the youngest was a 2-year-old. Also released were 10 people from Thailand and one from the Philippines.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Gaza, the truce’s start Friday morning brought the first quiet for 2.3 million Palestinians reeling and desperate from relentless Israeli bombardment that has killed thousands, driven three-quarters of the population from their homes and leveled residential areas.

He said both sides in Laos were prepared to exchange their prisoners, but only after a negotiated ceasefire takes effect.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If they were captured in Laos, they will be returned in Laos,” Soth said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists and the Laotian government have been discussing a cease- fire for a week, with little apparent suc- cess. The Vietnam peace agreement did not apply to the fighting in Laos except to define the role of foreign troops.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. embassy officials said that the Pathet Lao statement was their first concerning American prisoners in Laos since the Vietnam agreement was signed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North Vietnam, at the urging of the United States, has turned over a list of seven American military men and two American civilians held prisoner in Laos. The United States lists more than 300 men as missing in Laos, mostly pilots shot down on bombing missions. U.S. officials have asked Hanoi for a more detailed ac- counting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soth’s statement appears ‘o contradict<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earlier U.S. statements that the Americans captured in Laos would be freed under terms of the Vietnam cease- fire and probably released at Hanoi.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soth declined to discuss details about prisoners under Pathet Lao control or to say whether any Americans in addition to those on the North Vietnamese list were being held.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moves toward reaching a cease-fire, Prince Souvanna Phouma, the Laotian Prime Minister, met for an hour Saturday with the special Pathet Lao negotiator, Phoumi Vongvichit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No details of the meeting were disclosed. Government sources said that in a cabinet session Friday Souvanna failed to get approval for tentative areas of agreement that have been worked out so far in the private talks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued fighting was also reported going on in south and central Laos with increased air strikes by U.S. B52 bombers, Fill swing-wing bombers and tactical fighter-bombers used to support CIA- sponsored irregular troops.  |
