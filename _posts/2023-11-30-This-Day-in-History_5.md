Ziegler is the husband of Sarasota County School Board member and Moms for Liberty co-founder Bridget Ziegler. When asked about the investigation, Sarasota police did not confirm details.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they released a heavily redacted police report in response to The Washington Post’s inquiry that includes the words “rape,” “raped” and “sexually battered.” The incident, which the report indicates took place at a home in Sarasota, was reported to police in early October.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ziegler’s attorney, Derek Byrd, said in a statement, “We acknowledge the reports that there is an investigation being conducted by the Sarasota Police Department regarding Mr. Ziegler,” adding that his client “has been fully cooperative” with police.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We are confident that once the police investigation is concluded that no charges will be filed ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/30/christian-ziegler-florida-gop-chairman-criminal-investigation/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/30/christian-ziegler-florida-gop-chairman-criminal-investigation/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MORGANTON, N.C. ‘AP) — William E. Cobb stood caimly amidst the wreckage of his scat- tered political life Thursday and admitted it is not possible to main- tain a double family life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ Cobb, 40, boyish chairman of the North Carolina Republican party and a candidate for the State Sen- ate, revealed Wednesday night that for more than two years he has maintained two homes: one here with his blonde, attractive wife of 19 years, and their 3-year- old adopted son; the other in Reanoke, Va., where he said he has lived with a mysterious wom- an he identified only as Linda, and two children born of their re-_ lationship.   ‘Tensions Eased’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Anyone who lives under: a veil<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of secrecy lives under a strain,”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘said Cobb. “Now the secrecy is obliterated and there is a certain easing of personal tensions.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two women involved went into seculsion. Rebecca Summers, Cobb’s secretary, said Mrs. Cobb was ‘‘terribly upset, but was tak- ing it like a real trooper.’’ Mrs. Summers said Cobb’s wife has de- cided to stick by him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, in Roanoke, where Cobb maintained a home tnder the name of W. Edward Cobb, the woman with whom he said he lived there remained bessiged in their small but stylish home. Out- side, reporters and photographers clamored for pictures and some clue to her identity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cobb, who admitted the double family after being confronted by reporters, would not identify her,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other woman, described as<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blonde and attractive, was pack- ing her car, apparently preparing to leave Roanoke with her small children, when reporters arrived Thursday. She retreated into the house where she remained. Cobb, a Marine Corps pilot dur- ing World War II, was graduated from Yale in 1947, then moved to Morganton where he entered the lumber brokerage business with his father-in-law. Since then Cobb has been successful in business and in politics where he is given credit for putting the Republican party on its feet in a traditonal- ly Democratic state.
