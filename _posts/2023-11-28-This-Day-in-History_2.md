| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (AP) — In an age of deepfakes and post-truth, as artificial intelligence rose and Elon Musk turned Twitter into X, the Merriam-Webster word of the year for 2023 is “authentic.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authentic cuisine. Authentic voice. Authentic self. Authenticity as artifice. Lookups for the word are routinely heavy on the dictionary company’s site but were boosted to new heights throughout the year, editor at large Peter Sokolowski told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We see in 2023 a kind of crisis of authenticity,” he said ahead of Monday’s announcement of this year’s word. “What we realize is that when we question authenticity, we value it even more.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sokolowski and his team don’t delve into the reasons people head for dictionaries and websites in search of specific words.

Why have we given in to the bleat- ings of those who insist it 1s dan- gerous for a man to have an idea in his head? Why do we talk of saving ourselves by committing suicide—in the land of Jeffer- son?”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What is the matter with us anyhow?” he asked in an address at a Columbia University  by- centennial ceremony.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignorance, Fear<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The usual diagnosis is ignor- ance and fear. Ignorance leads many to confuse ends with means, to act as though material pro- gress were an end in itself rather than a means to great and noble ends. This, I suggest, is the peril in our hard-headed, prag- matic attitude that has helped us achieve our social and economic transformation, for if we ever succumb to materialism the meaning will have gone out of America,” he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need now is “to reconvert a population soaked in the spirit of materialism to the spirit of humanism ... or bit by bit we too will take on the visage of our<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amnene ¢ha manr_haathane *  |
