| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This idea of people just doing math and adding up numbers — that’s not the way voters vote,” Christie said this weekend on CNN. “And so I would say to everybody out there: Let’s let the campaign move forward.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christie has a point that you can’t just assume his supporters would go to Haley, the former South Carolina governor and ambassador to the United Nations. But the available evidence suggests that a large portion of them might.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that could certainly assist Haley, though not necessarily enough to win New Hampshire — and not very much at all elsewhere.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason to think voters could migrate from Christie to Haley is that, of the five major candidates left, these two largely monopolize the most middle-of-the-road, Trump-skeptical voters. That’s essentially Christie’s entire base of support, while Haley pulls largely but not exclusively from them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent Washington Post-Monmouth University poll in New Hampshire showed them combining for around two-thirds of primary vo ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/27/how-christie-dropping-out-could-help-haley/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/27/how-christie-dropping-out-could-help-haley/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOUSTON (AP) — The George Bush campaign consumed two years and $16.2 million and involved hundreds of thou- sands of miles of travel and countless speeches, rallies and handshakes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after all that, it barely put a dent in front-runner Ronald Reagan’s bandwagon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a week-long period of reassessment and a “‘traumatic weekend’’ of decision, Bush bowed to the realities Monday and said he had too little money and too few delegates to have a real chance of turning the tables now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bush said the decision went against all his instincts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said his own inclinations echoed the words on a button worn by his wife: ‘‘Stay In And Fight.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Bush stayed in what started as a crowded Republican field longer than any of the other seven major candidates who dropped out along the way. Bush had presented himself throughout the cam- paign as a moderate alternative to Reagan and said from the outset his strategy was to narrow the field to the two of them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am an optimist,’ Bush said at the news conference where he announced his withdrawal. ‘But I also know how to count to 998,"’ he added, referring to the total number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of major news organization projections say Reagan has already passed that total. The Associated Press delegate count, which is limited to those committed by law or party rule or by public declara- tion, is 919. :<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Padding around his home in barefeet — serving beer, cheese and crackers to the reporters who had covered his campaign — Bush pronounced the day ‘‘gloomy’’ and wondered aloud about the efforts that took up “two years of my life.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said he doubtless will go on to something else, noting that his career has moved from one step to another: World<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; War II pilot, successful businessman, con- gressman, candidate for the U.S. Senate, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, U.S. envoy to China, director of the Central Intelligence Agency and Republican national chairman.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I plan no more press conferences for awhile,’’ Bush said. “‘I plan to go pleasantly about decompressing. I'm not going to be petulant about it. I’m not going to go off on some retreat, at least on one where you can find me.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not petulant, Bush does retain an edge of bitterness about some aspects of the campaign.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says the high point of his effort came last week in Michigan when he trounced Reagan by a startling 25 percentage points.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bush leaves no doubt he is resentful that instead of hailing his victory as an upset of Reagan, many major news organizations declared that Reagan had won enough delegates that night to lock up the nomina- tion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As a result,’’ he said, “there is a widespread perception that the campaign is over’’ and that perception helped dry up contributions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bush acknowledged that an overly op- timistic projection of income for the cam- paign in April and May left it facing a $30- 0,000 deficit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Michigan was the high point, Bush says his campaign's low water mark came when he won Massachusetts only to find press coverage focusing on the surprisingly strong showing of Rep. John Anderson, R- Ill. He said he believes Anderson drained away votes from his own campaign overall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bush started his campaign early, Not be- ing bound to any official job or duties, he was free to travel and organize. In 1979 alone, he was on the road for 328 days and logged 246,000 miles.  |
