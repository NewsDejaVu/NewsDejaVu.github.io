| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This idea of people just doing math and adding up numbers — that’s not the way voters vote,” Christie said this weekend on CNN. “And so I would say to everybody out there: Let’s let the campaign move forward.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christie has a point that you can’t just assume his supporters would go to Haley, the former South Carolina governor and ambassador to the United Nations. But the available evidence suggests that a large portion of them might.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that could certainly assist Haley, though not necessarily enough to win New Hampshire — and not very much at all elsewhere.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason to think voters could migrate from Christie to Haley is that, of the five major candidates left, these two largely monopolize the most middle-of-the-road, Trump-skeptical voters. That’s essentially Christie’s entire base of support, while Haley pulls largely but not exclusively from them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent Washington Post-Monmouth University poll in New Hampshire showed them combining for around two-thirds of primary vo ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/27/how-christie-dropping-out-could-help-haley/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/27/how-christie-dropping-out-could-help-haley/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(By the Associated Press)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are excerpts from the edi- torial comment in the nation’s press on Wendell L. Willkie's withdrawal from the Republican presidential race:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New York Times (Ind.-Dem.)— His‘ withdrawal takes out of the con- test . . . the candidate .. . best fitted .. . for the Republican nom- ination for the presidency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleveland :Plain Dealer (Ind.- Dem.)—Willkie has been a powerful influence in the rejuvenation of the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Republican party. .. . Regardless of his own desires ... Dewey is now a candidate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indianapolis Star (Iind.-Rep.)— Mr. Willkie is philosophical and un- selfish—a good loser.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minneapolis Morning Tribune (Ind.)—The rejection of Willkie as an individual ... does not mean that his voice has fallen on deaf ears in Wisconsin or elsewhere.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicago Tribune (Rep.)—Mr. Will- kie’s path is already clearly marked. It will surprise no one if he now comes out openly for Mr. Roosevelt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicago Sun (Ind.)—By voting against Mr. Willkie they (Wisconsin Republicans) strengthened the grip of partisan reactionaries on the Re- publican party. -<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raleigh (NC) News and Observer (Dem.)— ... It is now clear that no candidate who takes a forthright position has a chance to win the Republican nomination.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nashville ‘Tennesseean (ind.- Dem.)—-What happened ... was... the virtual obliteration of Mr. Will- kie .. . and the extinguishment of the hopes of those Republicans who had fancied their party might rise above its ugly antecedents.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memphis Commercial Appeal (Ind.-Dem.)—He (Willkie) has been a  \determined protagonist in every- thing he undertakes, and the Re- publican old guard should not be too sure they are shut of ‘him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i (Ind.) Roosevelt must run again. . . . It was decided in the Wisconsin primary. The isolationists and reactoinaries, the labor baiters and small politicians of the Repub- lican party have finally achieved their supreme triumph-—the burial of Wendell Willkie’s presidential candidacy. ... The one Republican who offered even the hope of gen- uine liberal leadership has been, in effect, driven out of his party. The GOP bosses, led by backward-look- ing, bumbling, Harrison Spangler have prevailed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Louis -Post-Dispatch (Ind.)— He (Willkie) is the one Republican candidate who exhibited a grasp of the great world forces that are mov- ing today... . Willkie's willingness to break with the musty past, to embrace new doctrines in economics and political thought, to forge new trails and to set up new signposts, terrified the old guard. He was not, in their opinion, “safe.”  |
