| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Biden on Monday jumped at the chance to tussle with Republicans over the 2010 health-care law known as Obamacare after Donald Trump wrote on social media this weekend that he is “seriously looking at alternatives” to it, something for which Republicans had all but abandoned trying to fight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My predecessor, once again … called for cuts that could rip away health insurance for tens of millions Americans and Medicaid,” Biden said Monday at the White House. “They just don’t give up.

(AP) — President Carter, concluding a series of weekend campaign appearances for Democratic candidates, vowed Saturday to spur congressional action next year on the nation’s steadily rising health bill.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday's trip to New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Maine was the last in a series of one- day campaign trips — most of them on Saturdays — on behalf of Democratic candidates. Carter has planned a two<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day, c venture next week, wintiag up a 17-day stretch in which he will have visited 13 states.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before arriving here at midday to campaign for Gov. Ella T. Grasso, Carter told a rally in Buffalo that hospital costs have been going up twice as fast as the inflation rate, which has hovered at or near at<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;annual rate of 10 percent through much of 1978.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“One of the things I want to make sure Congress does next year IS pass a new hospital cost containment bill,’’ the president said in an address at Buffalo International Airport on behalf of New York Gov. Hugh Carey and other state Democrats.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration's hospital cost bill fell by the wayside as Congress concentrated on the energy program and the tax bill during the waning days of its recently-concluded session.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was the case Thursday when Carter campaigned in Tennessee, the president used a portion of his Buffalo speech to put in a plug for the newly announced anti-inflation program. It was in that vein that Carter lamented the failure of Congress to act on the hospital cost problem.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the New York contest, Carey has spent much of his campaign defending his two vetoes of legislation that would have restored the death penalty in New York. Carey also has stressed his successful efforts to roll back taxes im under Republican Gov. Nelson Rockefeller.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political observers say Carey and his Republican opponent, former state Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea, are running neck-and-neck.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter flew here to deliver two speeches on behalf of Mrs. Grasso, who is leading her ey op ponent, Rep. Ronald A. Sarasin, by a 50-41 margin, according to a Hartford Courant poll released Oct. 15.  |
