| Moscow Attack: Don’T Believe The Kremlin | Tragedy In Munich |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday’s terrorist attack at the Crocus City Hall concert venue near Moscow killed more than 100 people in a brutal crime against humanity. Many key facts are still unclear and rest assured they will become only less clear as the Kremlin works to exploit the crisis domestically and abroad. Coming shortly after his latest sham election the attack gave dictator Vladimir Putin a rallying cry one day after the Kremlin declared for the first time that Russia is in a “state of war” in Ukraine. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/moscow-attack-dont-believe-the-kremlin-isis-terrorists-civilian-deaths-putin-995046e5?mod=opinion_lead_pos5)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insane terror was how Israel’s Premier Golda Meir described it. Reprehensible and outrageous said U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield. Barbaric action were the words of U.S. Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott. International outlaws of the worst sort said the President of the United States. That’s a sampling of some of the reactions to the murders that started in the Israeli building in Olympic Village in Munich Germany; that have shocked the world. They occurred because Arab guerrillas unsuccessfully tried to abduct the entire Israeli team. The flags of more than 120 nations flying there in a plaza dedicated to peace among sportsmen are at half-mast. It truly is a time for mourning. This terrifying incident can only fan the flames that are ever present in the Middle East but it should serve as a warning to the world’s leaders that those flames must be doused. It also is another horrible reminder that because of its enemies a tiny land Israel must be continually on its guard. As President Nixon said: Traveling Israelis must constantly be on the alert for such attacks because the terrorists are international outlaws who are unpredictable. Israels requests for assurances of its safety and security have too long been ignored just as has the placing of the real responsibility for similar Arab guerrilla attacks — which started in 1968. World leaders who speak of peace should observe the admonition in an editorial in L’Osservatore Romano: Today’s attempt has a taste of treason more than just treachery. Yes it was treason existing side by side with loyalty in the games. |

| Is No Labels An Elaborate Grift With No Candidate? Their Secrecy Is Telling. | Presidential Race: Everybody Is Running |

| March 25, 2024 | January 31, 1967 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Labels the nonprofit trying to lure a third-party candidate to run for president this year should consider rebranding itself as No Candidate. In the two weeks since the group\s intentionally unidentified 800 delegates supposedly voted in a private virtual meeting to move forward with a plan to find a candidate a steady string of potential contenders have told No Labels No thanks. And there has been a concerning migration in messaging from No Labels which had been pushing two key ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/03/25/no-labels-lacks-third-party-candidate-2024-election/73058918007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One prominent Republican put it candidly: “There isn’t really any such thing as avoiding the Presidential sweepstakes. You can say to yourself convincingly you arent a candidate and your resolution when communicated to others will persuade them you are talking about Congress or mayor or governor. But not the Presidency. If the objective situation makes you a candidate you cant even believe yourself when you say: Im not a candidate.” Applying those rules there are a lot of candidates for the Republican nomination. The most obvious of course is George Romney. Mr. Nixon is a candidate if we are to believe such as Fred Seaton a Cabinet officer under General Eisenhower. He has written to national Republican officials saying very simply that Mr. Nixon deserves another crack at the office having come so close in 1960 and having performed such yeoman services since then. The others are less forward but not much less visible. If Romney fails which is likely I think the pressure will be on Charles Percy 1968’s Scranton. But then the spectre of Rockefeller arises. He has said as positively as he said in 1962 that there would be no new taxes in New York that he will not run for President. The adage is that taxes and death are inevitable to which I nominate the addition of Rockefeller as Presidential candidate. He did promise Jacob Javits that he wouldn’t run for President and Javits took that promise very seriously last spring after publicly hemming and hawing on the question whether he would support Rockefeller for re-election. After Rockefeller took the pledge Javits supported him wholeheartedly. Even so there are the cynics who say that Javits was dismayed when Rockefeller went on against great odds to win the election. If he had lost Javits would have been the indisputable No. 1 Republican in New York State. As it stands he is disputably No. 2. Disputably because there is the androgynous Mayor Lindsay who if you catch him at exactly the right exposure with the lens opening exactly set comes up a Republican. Mr. Javits openly aspires to national office. If Rockefeller had lost he might have bargained with other states on his own account. As it stands Rockefeller is firmly in control of his own state’s delegates so that when Javits goes to a potential Presidential candidate to stress his own honor beauty and glory and the candidate asks how many delegates can Javits deliver he is reduced to derivative-talk: “I’m sure I can persuade old Rocky old pal to give us the votes you want.” That in political circles is no substitute for: I will deliver the New York delegation. And then...and then: what if Rockefeller should himself decide to go one more time. Here is the situation that vexes some prominent Republican liberals. Many of them are agreed that Rockefeller was primarily responsible for the failure of the drive to head off Goldwater in 1964. If Rockefeller they say had retired after his defeat in New Hampshire the GOP liberals could have got behind Henry Cabot Lodge or William Scranton and hoped to kill off Goldwater in the primaries. Well suppose Rockefeller does it again? Suppose that Romney falters in the public opinion polls which after all is no less likely than that he should falter in the private opinion polls which he has resplendently done — and Rockefeller coaxed on by his money and his money’s adulators conceives it yet again his duty to save the Republic. Quite possible and the more possible the more likely the defeat of Lyndon Johnson who at this moment is being sold short — too short by far in this man’s opinion — as a candidate for re-election. The prevailing confusion in left-liberalism cannot help but augment the chances of centrist Republicans the most conspicuous of whom is Richard Nixon. The gentleman is greatly competent much devoted to the Republican Party that Javits finds all but unrecognizable. And besides he gives evidence of a strategic stamina. What is it that considering what happened to Nixon in California in 1962 they don’t say about him what they started saying about Stassen almost immediately after 1948? There is a certain amount of iron in Nixon. |

| Heavy Lies The Crown | Anne In A Swimsuit Our Viewpoint |

| March 25, 2024 | August 20, 1971 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in London last week when the febrile madness of Where Is Kate? was blowing up social media and The Curious Mystery of the Doctored Mother’s Day Photograph consumed every news outlet and dinner table conversation. After The Associated Press issued a “kill notification” on the botched Photoshopped image of a suspiciously glossy Princess of Wales flanked by her beaming progeny there was a typical outburst of tabloid pomposity questioning whether Kensington Palace could ever be considered a ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/opinion/kate-middleton-cancer-diagnosis.html)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People get excited about the darndest things. About for example a photograph of Britain’s Princess Anne walking along an African beach in a swimsuit. Not a bikini mind you — just a one-piece suit of a style not unlike those commonly seen on beaches since long before Princess Anne was born. The British Broadcasting Corporation’s issuance of such a photograph was unprecedented and for a variety of reasons it caused something of a stir. Royalty occupies a very special place in the British concept of the way things ought to be. Presumably to help assure the continuance of this attitude news photographers have heretofore been barred from taking swimsuit shots of the royal family — its distaff side at any rate. Perhaps what we are witnessing is the start of a new dispensation. It’s not likely to be continued though until the excitement dies down a bit. The whole affair reminds us (somewhat vaguely granted) of an episode said to have occurred a long long time ago in Spain. It seems that a visitor to the court ventured to present the queen a pair of elegant silk stockings but was turned away with the haughty dictum ‘‘The queen of Spain has no legs.’’ It now appears that Princess Anne does — and rather nice ones by all accounts. |
