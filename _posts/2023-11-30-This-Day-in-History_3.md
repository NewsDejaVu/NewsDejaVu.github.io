He had rare intellectual gifts, but he could be surprisingly insecure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one constant with Kissinger, who died on Wednesday at 100, was that he was always interesting. He was a charmer and a flatterer to people he liked or thought could do him some good (or harm).

Bunche, former U.N. undersecretary general for special political affairs and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950, died at 12:40 a.m. EST today at New York Hospital after a long illness. He was 67.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunche’s widow said the Negro diplomat entered the hospital two days ago for new tests and had “seemed to be doing very well.” He had been suffering from kidney malfunction, diabetes, heart disease and various complications for months.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunche retired from his United Nations post—the highest ever held by an American official—in October. His career had been identified with the United Nations from its inception until his decision to step down from the post of undersecretary due to ill health.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buche was working in the State Department in 1945 when he received the assignment to begin plans for an_ international organization which could bring some order to a world wracked by a war that was drawing to its close. He negotiated the armistice agreements between the new state of Israel and her Arab neighbors in 1948 and won the Nobel Peace prize for his efforts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1949 he succeeded Count Folke Bernadotte as the U.N. Mediator when the Swedish nobleman was assassinated in Jerusalem. Much of his time was taken up in the early years of the United Nations with trusteeship of former colonial possessions and dependent ter-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ritories.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He became an undersecretary i! 1955 with no. specific responsibilities except to work directly with the secretary general on knotty international problems.  |
