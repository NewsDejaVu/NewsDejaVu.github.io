But these three guys did,” said Rich Price, who hosted his nephew and two friends for the long weekend.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ali Ahmad, all age 20, were out for a walk Saturday after the party for Price’s twin sons when a man approached them.

An Ak- ron doctor who is experienced in jtreating gunshot wounds said  Saturday that a Kent State Uni-  versity student he treated was ‘not shot by a military or police weapon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four students were killed Monday and nine wounded when National Guardsmen opend fire during a confrontation with anti- ;war protestors. The university ‘has been closed for the remain- der of the spring quarter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Joseph W. Ewing, a plas- tic surgeon who treated bullet ;wounds while with the 109th Evacuation Hospital in Europe jin World War II, said that Don- jald MacKenzie, 20, of Richboro, Pa., was shot in the back of the   neck within an inch of the spinal  cord by a small caliber bullet that came out his jaw and cheek. MacKenzie was discharged ;from Akron St. Thomas Hospital ‘Friday. Ewing said the bullet Shattered the jaw and left a hole about the size of a nickel in McKenzie’s cheek.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ewing said the bullet that struck MacKenzie was steel- jacketed and nonexplosive. No steel fragments were left in the student’s face, he said.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If it had not been steel-jack- eted, it would have shattered when it hit his jawbone,’’ Ewing said. “‘An explosive bullet would have killed the student.” ;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  “A military weapon would have blown his head apart,” he maintained. .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I can’t tell you what the boy was shot by, but it was not by a military or police weapon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Those are too big to have left that small a hole in his face.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, the Elyria Chronicle- Telegram reported that uniden- tified sources in the shootings investigation had told them that at least one of the four students killed was struck by a nonmili- tary bullet. The source said the metal fragment taken from the body were not typical of wounds inflicted by M-1 rifles, the news- paper said. :<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ests were reported contin- uing to determine definitely whether the metal fragments came from a military weapon.  |
