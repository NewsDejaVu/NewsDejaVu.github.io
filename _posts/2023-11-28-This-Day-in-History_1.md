| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas Supreme Court on Tuesday scrutinized efforts to clarify exceptions to the state’s abortion ban, which a growing number of women say forced them to continue pregnancies despite serious risks to their health.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Texas lawsuit is among the biggest challenges to abortion bans in the U.S. since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year. In July, several Texas women gave emotional testimony about carrying babies they knew would not survive and doctors unable to offer abortions despite their spiraling conditions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A judge later ruled that Texas’ ban was too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications, but that order was swiftly put on hold after the state appealed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision now rests with Texas’ highest court, and during arguments Tuesday, one justice on the all-Republican panel signaled concerns about potentially giving physicians too broad discretion to provide exceptions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This very well could open the door far more widely than you’re acknowledging, ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/abortion-texas-exceptions-lawsuit-82611bda29112775247d8e7adbc0a81b](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-texas-exceptions-lawsuit-82611bda29112775247d8e7adbc0a81b) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DES MOINES, Iowa (AP)—A suit that seeks to have lowa's abortion law declared unconstitutional was filed in U.S. District Court here Wednesday by two pregnant women and two Des Moines doctors.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suit was filed by Gordon Allen, an attorney for the lowa Civil Liberties Union.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seeks to permanently stop Atty. Gen Richard Turner and Polk County Atty. Ray Fenton from enforcing the law.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state’s abortion law prohibits any abortion except to save the life of a woman.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women bringing the suit were iden- tified only as ‘‘Jane Doe”’ and ‘‘Sally Roe.”’ The doctors are gynecologist-obstetricians Drs. Milton Mark and Don Newland.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen said the suit was filed because hospital administrators and doctors ‘‘from all over the state’’ are confused whether abortions are now legal in Iowa.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Texas abortion law is unconstitutional. That law is similar to Iowa's and it prompted Turner to write a letter Feb. 15 to Sen. Barton Schwieger, R. Waterloo, saying he believes the Iowa abortion law is void.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen said Turner hasn't issued a formal<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; opinion on the legality of abortions in Iowa. He said this has resulted in a ‘chilling effect’’ on the constitutional rights of lowa women seeking an abortion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen said he believes that Turner's in- formal opinion is ‘not enough” for Iowa's hospitals and doctors who fear possible legal action if they perform abortions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“All we're doing is trying to relieve the doctor's mind and remove the obstacle,” Allen said.  |
