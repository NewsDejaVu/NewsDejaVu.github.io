| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AL BIREH, West Bank (AP) — Hamas militants on Saturday released 17 hostages, including 13 Israelis, from captivity in the Gaza Strip, while Israel freed 39 Palestinian prisoners in the latest stage of a four-day cease-fire.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late-night exchange was held up for several hours after Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement. The delay underscored the fragility of the cease-fire, which has halted a war that has shocked and shaken Israel, caused widespread destruction across the Gaza Strip, and threatened to unleash wider fighting across the region.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war erupted on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants in Gaza burst across the border into southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting some 240 others, including, women, children and older people. Israel immediately declared war, carrying out weeks of airstrikes and a ground offensive that have left over 13,300 Palestinians dead, according to health authorities in the Hamas-controlled territory.

The 19-year-old student-teacher told reporters she felt ‘wonderful, con- sidering the situation I've been in.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hostages — a 19-year- old woman and 40-year-old man — were killed along with six of their nine captors when Dutch troops stormed the train just before dawn. Twelve persons were injured — one terrorist, two soldiers and nine hostages.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials said Miss J. M. O. Monsjou of Groningen and M. Van Baarsel of Elst were fatally shot when they jumped to their feet during the. 10- minute attack, disregarding soldiers’ orders, shouted over loudspeakers, to stay down. A government spokesman said they were not killed by bullets from the soldiers’ weapons.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no casualties in the school,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the bloodshed, the Dutch government said it had no choice but to use force to free the hostages after negotiations and psycholologi- cal pressure failed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hospital source quoted one of the hostages as saying the Moluceans had drawn up a “death list’’ with the names of captives to be killed if the government refused _ their demands,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hostage reportedly claimed Dutch officials were aware of the list, but the report could not be confirmed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hospital spokesman in Groningen said the former hostages were generally in good shape, and _ most returned home after physical and psychological examina- tions by’a specially assembled medical team, refusing an offer to remain in the hospital for 24 hours,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack began at first light, when six F104 jet fighters buzzed the train. Some 30 commandos, protected by covering fire from 35 marksmen, sprang from their foxholes, blasted<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todav's chuckle<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open the door of the train with plastic explosives and burst inside firing automatic weapons.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the attack on the train was under way, troops rammed through the brick wall of the village school at Bovensmilde, a few miles to the south, in an armored personnel vehicle, freeing four more hostages and arresting four pajama-clad terrorists.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounded terrorist was reported in grave condition, and one former hostage was hospitalized with wounds, officials said. The six other surviving gunmen were taken<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to local jails, and under Dutch law it may be months before they are formally charged. Officials said the dead in- cluded one woman terrorist and the leader of the gunmen, identified only as‘‘Max.”’ Justice Minister Andries Van Agt said the government ordered the raids after it appeared further negotiations would be futile. The gunmen were asking Dutch help in gaining independence from Indonesia for their homeland, and a plane to fly them and 21 jailed comrades out of the country. See DUTCH, page six  |
