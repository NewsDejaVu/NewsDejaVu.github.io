| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AL BIREH, West Bank (AP) — Hamas militants on Saturday released 17 hostages, including 13 Israelis, from captivity in the Gaza Strip, while Israel freed 39 Palestinian prisoners in the latest stage of a four-day cease-fire.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late-night exchange was held up for several hours after Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement. The delay underscored the fragility of the cease-fire, which has halted a war that has shocked and shaken Israel, caused widespread destruction across the Gaza Strip, and threatened to unleash wider fighting across the region.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war erupted on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants in Gaza burst across the border into southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting some 240 others, including, women, children and older people. Israel immediately declared war, carrying out weeks of airstrikes and a ground offensive that have left over 13,300 Palestinians dead, according to health authorities in the Hamas-controlled territory.

But Justice Minister Andreas van Agt said there is no indication that release is near for the other hostages aboard the train near Assen or four others held in a schoolhouse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both women looked relaxed and rested after their night in the hospital, where Mrs. Brouwer is employed in the personnel department. They were released from the hospital after examinations by a physician and a psychiatrist.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Agt said a six-hour mediation meeting Saturday bet- ween the militants on the train and two leaders of the South Moluccan community made little progress, and a second meet- ing has not been fixed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t yet see any reason to be optimistic that it will all soon be over,” he said as the twin sieges went into their third week.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justice Ministry spokeswoman Toos Faber said the ter- rorists’ demands are basically unchanged. They have de- manded the release of 21 other South Moluccans imprisoned for terrorist activity and a plane to fly them all out of the country.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Faber said there was no connection between the release of Mrs. Elienbroek and Mrs. Brouwer and the session Saturday between the terrorists and mediators Josina Soumokil and Hassan Tan. Another official suggested the Moluccans freed the women to get rid of a ‘‘troublesome burden.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials had repeatedly sought the release of Mrs. Ellenbroek-Prinsen, who is five months pregnant, but they apparently had not known that Mrs. Brouwer-Korf was two months pregnant.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Faber said the terrorists gave no indication they would free the women until they telephoned the government crisis center at Assen Sunday afternoon and asked officials to send for the women. Dr. Franz Tutuhatunewa, health minister in the government-in-exiie of the phantom South Moluccan republic, was sent to get them, and an ambulance took them to a hospital at nearby Groningen.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women were the first hostages freed by the 7 to 10 ter- rorists aboard the train since they allowed a number of elderly passengers to escape when they took it over. The four gunmen at the school freed 105 children and a teacher May 27 after about half of the youngsters became ill. They are still holding four teachers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official sources reported that the government believes any formula to end the sieges must be linked to a long-term solution to the South Moluccan community’s campaign for the indepen- dence of their native islands from Indonesia.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The islands became part of Indonesia in 1949 along with the rest of the Dutch East Indies.  |
