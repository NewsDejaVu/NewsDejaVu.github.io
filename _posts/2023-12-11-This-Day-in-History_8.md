| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ousted Fox News host Tucker Carlson is starting his own streaming service promising to “tell the unadorned truth” to fans for $72 a year he announced Monday. Commentary interviews Carlson-flavored news reports and documentaries even an advice show will be offered on the Tucker Carlson Network which is essentially staffed by the people who used to work for him at Fox.

If not and he sticks to his walkout the network said announcer Hugh Downs will be host. A spokesman said the Paar name would remain on the program despite Paar\s dramatic walkout Thursday night after announcing tearfully to a studio audience that he was quitting because of NBC\s handling of a disagreement over a questionable joke censored from his Wednesday night show. Parr told newsmen later that he had not abandoned his television career. Meanwhile another broadcasting company announced it had put its entire facilities at Paar\s disposal for the production of any kind of show he felt would best serve his purpose or to make any public statement he wishes to make. 8-Minute Walkout Speech The offer was telegraphed to Paar this morning by Elroy McCaw president of Gotham Broadcasting Corp. which operates radio stations in New York Denver Colo. Seattle and Centralia Wash. and television stations in Denver and Seattle. Paar\s walkout speech—an emotional eight-minute talk which began after about 12 minutes during which Paar appeared to be in a normal happy mood—and the rest of the program which Downs took over were taped as usual early Thursday evening and went on the air at 11:15 p.m. without editing NBC announced the walkout—and its hope Paar would reconsider and return—even before television audiences saw the show. After Paar\s departure two of his guests comedians Shelley Berman and Orson Bean castigated the network with greater bitterness than Paar himself. They occasionally remarked The probably won\t run this. Downs—who said he didn\t work for NBC but for the Paar show said he would be very surprised if it didn\t. He said the censorship of the previous night had been a matter of taste not a matter of free speech which he praised the network for supporting. |---

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pregnant Texas woman whose fetus has a fatal condition left the state to get an abortion elsewhere before the state Supreme Court on Monday rejected her unprecedented challenge of one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S. Kate Cox a 31-year-old mother of two had spent nearly a week seeking court permission in Texas to end her pregnancy but her attorneys said she could not wait any longer and left the state.

The deeply divided court stopped short of reversing its landmark 1973 ruling of Roe vs. Wade which gave women the constitutional right to have an abortion but sanctioned attempts by Missouri lawmakers to restrict a woman’s ability to get one. Illinois legislators opposed to abortion immediately seized on the ruling as a pattern for new measures that will be taken before the General Assembly this fall. “The battles are going to be in the state Legislature” predicted Leonard Strickman dean of the Northern Illinois University College of Law. Citing the new latitude given to the states state Rep. Penny Pullen said she will revise a bill that would make it illegal for doctors to perform outpatient abortions on patients more than 20 weeks pregnant if they determine the fetus could live. The bill is before a legislative committee in Springfield. “I think we probably can go beyond (what the bill says now) and would be rewriting this bill to whatever the Supreme Court would allow” said Pullen a leading anti-abortion activist. “There is some protection for the unborn in the Missouri law. I would have liked for the court to overturn Roe vs. Wade because the carnage will continue.” The ruling coupled with the possibility that abortion laws will be tightened further when the Supreme Court rules next year on three other cases was cheered by abortion foes. Abortion rights activists denounced the ruling saying it will galvanize support for their position and vowing to make the issue a “litmus test” for legislators seeking re-election. “Legislators are going to be in |---

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a small rural Missouri high school two English teachers shared a secret: Both were posting adult content on OnlyFans the subscription-based website known for sexually explicit content. The site and others like it provide an opportunity for those willing to dabble in pornography to earn extra money — sometimes lots of it. The money is handy especially in relatively low-paying fields like teaching and many post the content anonymously while trying to maintain their day jobs.

But Miss Lewandowski 25 who for $2000 struck 18 nude poses of her 37-25-37 figure published in this month\s Penthouse magazine says she will go to court if necessary to keep her job. “Dr. Knapp says I quit but I didn’t” she said Monday. “I went in to talk to him fast week and said I might quit if I thought it would be impossible for me to do my job this fall but we just left it up in the air.”” Knapp who said he has seen the photos but has no personal feeling about Miss Lewan- dowski\s job insists she quit. “She resigned. That\s it” he said. “That\s not true. He is very much against me hecause of this” countered Miss Lewandowski who uses the name Barbie Lewis for her part-time modeling. She said she does not believe publication of her picture in the buff will affect her ability to do her job. “I\m still the same old me she said. *\I can still goof around with the kids and everything just like I used lo. I think 13-year- old kids can accept this. Besides most of them will probably never see the picture unless their mothers get upset about it. She added “If they saw the magazine they would have learned a course in sex education.” Some mothers apparently have been complaining she conceded although she said she has had no direct adverse comments about the photos from anyone except Knapp. Greendale principal Donald Baumgart suggested it might be better for Miss Lewandowski to look for other work. “I\d guess that if the magazine got into the hands of the kids it would be somewhat embarrassing for her” he said. “! think it might bother some of the kids and affect their demeanor in school.”’ Miss Lewandowski said she will go to court to save her job. “They just can\t do this to me”’ she said. “Ifa hittle kid would come up to me this fall and say he saw my picture in the nude I would just tell him that’s fine now let\s get back to work.” |---

Bremer the onetime photography student charged with shooting Democratic presidential candidate George C. Wallace is described as a quiet but confident loner. The picture drawn by relatives friends and acquaintances of the man who is accused of gunning down Wallace and three others at a Maryland shopping center Monday is that of a youth who kept his opinions to himself developed few friendships and was something of a puzzle even to his family. Bremer 21 is being held in lieu of $200000 bond in Maryland under federal charges of assaulting a candidate for public office and a federal officer and under State charges of assault with intent to kill. Although acquaintances including classmates in his college photography class said they were not aware of political interests or activity on the part of the blond young man with close-cropped hair effects found in his Milwaukee apartment Monday night indicated otherwise. Among the items in the West Side apartment were a Confederate flag and newspaper clippings about Wallace’s campaign some dating to 1968 when Wallace staged a third-party effort. “He must have been for George Wallace because he had a Wallace sticker across the door’’ said Stephen Wasche 17 a neighbor in the apartment house. Bremer moved into the apartment from his family’s South Side home last fall. Neighbors said he dropped from sight about a month ago. Bremer’s truck driver father William 58 said his son had ‘never mentioned anything political’ but he said he had learned that his son was a ‘‘dues-paying member of the 12th Ward Democratic unit.”’ Notebooks found in the apartment included one with the words ‘‘Cheer up Oswald”’ in large print. Then in smaller print were the words ‘“‘white collar conservative ... middle class Republican ... suburbanite robot.” Members of Bremer’s family--who hadn’t seen him since he moved to the apartment in October—described him as “shy and timid’ and they expressed disbelief that he could have been involved in the shooting. “We could never talk to him” said a younger brother Roger 18 ‘We never knew much about him.” Roger said his mother Sylvia 57 had tried to visit Arthur at the apartment but he ‘‘slammed the door in her face.” Among the items found in the apartment were two boxes of shells—one containing 21 .38-caliber shells the other 23 9mm cartridges—and seven targets as well as some gun magazines. |---

Laird said Monday that the scuttling of the U.S. foreign aid program could adversely affect withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam. But Laird told a White House news conference he plans to tell South Vietnamese officials this week that he does not expect the Senate’s rejection of the overseas assistance program will stand. “I am going to assure the Vietnamese that ... corrective action will be taken”’ Laird said. Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee agreed after a meeting Monday that the foreign aid program should be revived but controversy loomed ‘over the duration of any stopgap measure to keep it alive and the Shape of any long term foreign aid formula. Laird after an hour-long meeting with President Nixon Said the Senate’s Friday night vote against the program ‘‘could come at no worse time’’ because the administration is attempting to “move from confrontation to negotiation.’’ He mentioned Specifically the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) and what he termed “exploratory or Phase 1’’ talks on Mutual Balance Force Reduction. Laird acknowledged that the Vietnamese military assistance program is not in the foreign aid bill voted down by the Senate. But he said substantial funds for Vietnamese economic aid are affected. “The success of the American withdrawal action in Vietnam and the whole negotiating field will be affected by such an action”’ Laird said. The Vietnamization program he continued is aimed at “preparing the Vietnamese to take on the responsibility themselves not only militarily but also economically.” Laird who leaves Tuesday morning for a trip to Vietnam said he intends to inform the South Vietnamese leaders that he does not believe the Senate action is final and “that this program will go forward.” The White House said adoption of a resolution to continue foreign aid spending authority past Nov. 15 is imperative. And a Pentagon spokesman said military assistance ‘is absolutely essential’’ in U.S. strategic planning. The Foreign Relations Committee spent some 90 minutes behind closed doors discussing the future and the impact of last Friday night’s Senate vote that killed the $2.9-billion foreign aid authorization bill. No votes were taken at the committee session and no formal decisions made. |---

The 6-foot 10-inch center drove physicians and nurses away brandishing a chair leg and was locked in the room more than an hour before he was induced to come out peacefully his attending physician reported. Tear gas and water hoses were used unsuccessfully in attempts to dislodge the giant basketball star. Finally Parr talked with County Atty. Richard D. Rogers and the Rev. Samuel B. George pastor of the First Presbyterian Church through an open window and agreed to allow them to enter the room. He threw the chair leg out the window. He was taken immediately to surgery to repair the cuts on his wrists. Doctors said Parr had lost considerable blood but the cuts were not dangerous. The room was a shambles they said. Rogers said Parr would be taken to the State Hospital at Topeka to be kept there until the arrival of Parr’s father. An attending physician who would not be quoted by name said Parr was taken to the hospital Tuesday night after he had become threatening at a private home where he roomed. Wednesday when nurses attempted to administer medication Parr became violent and broke furniture and glass in the room. Attempts of physicians to subdue him were futile and the door to an adjoining room was locked. Parr threatened to hit anyone coming in to the room with an upraised chair the doctors reported. Parr a senior student of above average scholastic standing has been named to the Big Eight all-conference team for three straight years. He played a big part in Kansas State\s winning the conference championship and region. |---

Miss Louise Doyle religious worker and John W. Newman 26 year old father of three children were found dead in an abandoned house near here after police had searched for them for a week. Three bullet wounds were found in Newman\s body. Miss Doyle was killed by a shot through the heart. No weapons were found. County authorities traced movements of the few boyfriends of the slain girl. Mrs. Newman was calm today as she recited her discovery of the first intimation of friendly relations between her husband and the girl. She denied though that they had been intimate. She did not know how long they had been friendly. I found someone had called him at the factory last Friday—the day they both disappeared she said. John was working overtime and left shortly after the conversation. Then I found the girl had said she would be ready in a few minutes. Newman\s automobile was found the day after he and Miss Doyle disappeared. It had been abandoned on a lonely country road. The automobile was five miles from the deserted house where the murder mystery was unearthed by two farm hands who had gone to clean up the premises. Police announced the sole theory today that a jealous rival had killed Newman and Miss Doyle while they were riding carried their bodies to the cottage and driven the machine as far as the gasoline supply lasted. Diamond rings and other jewelry worn by the girl had not been taken and Newman\s pockets had not been searched police said. The body of Miss Doyle was in one room of the cottage and Newman was found in another room. Newman was shot through the forehead and through the left side. A bullet had pierced the girl\s heart. Rings had not been removed from her fingers. Mrs. Newman with her three children stoutly defended her husband today. The brother sister and mother of Miss Doyle could give no clue. |---

Ashley Dayer is an associate professor in the Fish and Wildlife Conservation department at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg Virginia.

Its aim: to find the positive human effects of bird feeding. ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bird-feeding-is-not-just-birds-may-be-good-human-soul-researchers](https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bird-feeding-is-not-just-birds-may-be-good-human-soul-researchers) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stillness of early morning thousands of wings rustle as the day’s food arrives for birds in two city parks—thanks to a gaunt sick 80-year-old man. “I don’t care about myself ... not anymore” says Raymond Lopez. “I’m only interested in helping all things that suffer and all things that are hungry.” Sometimes friends say Lopez himself goes hungry to provide feed for the birds at Echo and MacArthur parks. A retired Hollywood makeup man Lopez has lived alone in a small frame house since his wife died in 1965. He says most of his pension and Social Security checks go to pay the delivery man who comes every Tuesday with 2800 pounds of feed. The bill is about $150 a week. “I spend everything Ive got on the birds” says Lopez. “Life for me is insignificant except for the birds.” Last May heart trouble and other medical problems forced Lopez to stop making his daily rounds and a neighbor Manuel Cerda took over. Cerda a 64-year-old unemployed auto worker says he’s glad to transport the feed in his station wagon because Lopez cares so much for the birds. “My wife and I say ‘Mr. Lopez why don’t you relax and take a trip?’ Well he doesn’t say much. He just says I’d rather go hungry myself than let my birds go hungry.’” Lopez keeps one pigeon at home as a pet and is nursing two cripples. All have the run of the house. And as Cerda leaves each morning at dawn he sets out feed on Lopez’ roof. About 150 pigeons doves sparrows and bluejays alight for breakfast. |---
