He said his law- yers also told him to wait until<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his legal case challenging his exclusion from Congress is set- tled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“T don’t want anything to hap- pen in New York City,’’ Powell told a news conference on his exile island just off the Florida coast.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very Reluctant<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“T am reluctantly, very reluc- tantly changing my plans but I can’t go against the advice of the people I trust,’’ he said, “I want to go back but not if it means violence and _ bloodshed and my people tell me it would mean violence and bloodshed.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powell said he would know within a few days when he would be able to return to Har- ‘lem, and whether he would be arrested.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, he said, he would stay on Bimini until he is advised there was no longer any danger of arrest or a confronta- tion between the Negroes in Harlem and police.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“T don’t want te be blamed for violence or bloodshed nor do I<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want to cause any,” he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said he would not have announced on Monday that he was going to walk the street of Harlem on Sunday if he had known ‘‘things were so serious in Harlem.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powell slipped into Miami during the day and for the sec- ond time signed a certificate of acceptance to run for the 18th District congressional seat, the one Congress barred him from. He was on ground about 20 minutes at Miami International   Airport.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He signed a similar document March 9 but it was ruled invalid because it had been executed before a New York Democratic nominating committee had asked Powell to run again. The committee met Wednesday and made the request.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republican nominee, Lu- cille Pickette Williams, ‘“‘is a lovely woman,’ Powell said. “She belongs to my church. She is a fine lady and I would never say anything against her.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   |
