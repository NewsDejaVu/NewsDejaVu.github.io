| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — Campaigning in Iowa this year, Donald Trump said he was prevented during his presidency from using the military to quell violence in primarily Democratic cities and states.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling New York City and Chicago “crime dens,” the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination told his audience, “The next time, I’m not waiting. One of the things I did was let them run it and we’re going to show how bad a job they do,” he said. “Well, we did that. We don’t have to wait any longer.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trump has not spelled out precisely how he might use the military during a second term, although he and his advisers have suggested they would have wide latitude to call up units. While deploying the military regularly within the country’s borders would be a departure from tradition, the former president already has signaled an aggressive agenda if he wins, from mass deportations to travel bans imposed on certain Muslim-majority countries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A law first crafted in the nation’s infan ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/trump-military-insurrection-act-2024-election-03858b6291e4721991b5a18c2dfb3c36](https://apnews.com/article/trump-military-insurrection-act-2024-election-03858b6291e4721991b5a18c2dfb3c36) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ee ea a ee ee a a er ea. Sr   Peru's conservative military men probably have given the Communist ~-Castroist forces ‘in Latin America a helping hand and 'struck a blow at President Ken- “nedy’s Alliance for Progress.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The military seizure of the gov- ernment in Lima was not based /on reason or on logic but on emo- tionalism. It was a thing the Latin Americans call ‘“personalismo’’— a big grudge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The June 10 election in Peru was important for the whole hemisphere. By refusing to let constitutional processes operate, Peru's military drove home some doleful truths.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election was a test whether old habits could be broken, wheth- er oligarchies and military lead- ers could change their spots and reform. Peru's experience indi- cates they cannot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not an Isolated Case.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not an isolated case. It ‘resembles Argentina's experience, demonstrating the blind spots af- flicting the military in much of   Latin America. The Argentine   army did not like the results of   an election last spring, so it /' moved in and installed a figure- head president.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Argentina's case embarrassed the United States. Argentina is too important a country to let go down the drain, but there was ‘only a basically illegal, imposed government to work with. Accept- ‘ing it, the United States drew   taunts from its enemies and criti-  cism among its friends.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Argentina, Peru is an im- ‘portant nation in the Alliance scheme. Its future is a critical matter to Latin America. Yet to work hand in glove with an illegal regime imposed by the army is (to feed ammunition to the ex-   treme left.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paradox Explained.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paradox in the military's action is this: Of the three major candidates in the June 10 election, only Victor Raul Haya de la Torre ran on an openly anti-Com- munist platform. His popular Rev- olutionary Alliance Party had co- operated for six years with the intelligent government of Presi- dent Manuel Prado. It had shed its old extremist attitudes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Haya’s op- ponents might have been suspect by a conservative military leader- ship. Fernando Belaunde Terry flirted with the Communists and Castroists. Former dictator Manu- el Odria did not reject extreme left support. The Communists were interested in one main goal: Haya, as a “‘reformist,"’ had to be stopped by any means.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haya got more votes than any of seven candidates, though not the third of all votes required for election. But the army could not prove fraud, even though it made the charge. There was a _ pussi- bility that when the election was thrown to Congress July 28, Haya would make a deal with Odria.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military leaders would not stand still for that. They moved in. Probably they have ended for good Haya’s political hopes in Peru. But they have not ended his party’s influence, and they may only have succeeded in driving its members to violence. Peru may be in for a rough time, and if so, there will be wide repercus- sions in Latin America.  |
