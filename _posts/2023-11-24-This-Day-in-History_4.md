| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A day after the Washington Commanders’ defense gave up 431 yards and 45 points in a loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Coach Ron Rivera fired defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio and defensive backs coach Brent Vieselmeyer. Rivera will call the defense for the remaining five games of the season, and Cristian Garcia, formerly the team’s assistant defensive backs/nickel coach, will serve as the interim defensive backs coach.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard Rodgers, the team’s senior defensive assistant/safeties coach will maintain his same role and help Rivera with some aspects of game-planning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rivera said Friday he had been contemplating the moves “for a little bit” and felt it was the right time after the loss to the Cowboys.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is not an indictment on Jack and Brent, because those guys work their [butts] off trying to get things right and trying to do things for us,” Rivera said. “But for whatever reason, it wasn’t coming together.

(4). Sam Fran- cis, former All-America fullback at the University of Nebraska, stepped out Friday as head foot- ball coach at Kansas State col- lege, a Big Six school which hasn’t enjoyed a victory on the gridiron since 1944.   No successor was announced immediately.   Francis’ resignation, originally submitted Oct. 19 after the Kan- sas State Wildcats had lost a 47-7 game to the University of Missouri for their fifth defeat of the year, was accepted at a meeting of the state board of regents.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* oa *<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE WILDCATS closed their 10-game season with a 25-7 set- back at the hands of Florida university. It was their 26th defeat in a row.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the first year of coach- ing for Francis, who was ap- pointed head coach last February to succeed Hobbs Adams.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board of regents, in a pre- pared statement, said Francis stated “I have become convinced that my assistants and I cannot do a job of Big Six caliber under the existing financial status.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ie i *<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KANSAS STATE College President Milton Eisenhower, present at a meeting of the ath- letic committee of the board of regents here, said “I'm terribly disappointed that Sam is leav- ing Kansas State college. I fee! today exactly as I did a year age when he joined our staff—that he has great qualities of leader- ship, knows football superbly and is an outstanding teacher.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Our financial problem at Kan- sas State is a very difficult one We are located in a small town with a small stadium. Our fi- nancial resources are probably not half as great as those of any other Big Six school.”  |
