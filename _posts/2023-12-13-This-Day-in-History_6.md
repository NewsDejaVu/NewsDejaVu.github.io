| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIY iMessage-on-Android workarounds are nothing new, but the movement got a boost last month — U.K. phone maker Nothing and a start-up called Sunbird released an app that let owners of a niche Android phone easily send and receive iMessages.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party didn’t last long, though: After launching a beta version of the Nothing Chats app in late November, the app was withdrawn from the Google Play Store because of concerns over how the service handled user data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast-forward to last Tuesday, when a company called Beeper launched its own app — Beeper Mini — to bring iMessage to Android. The twist? Anyone with an Android phone could use it. All you had to do was download it from the Google Play Store, something Beeper says happened more than 100,000 times.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was by many accounts a more elegant, more responsible way to send iMessages from an Android device.

Robert J. Sloan 13, served a term as stale senator in Nebraska. He's a pgraduate o Towa State College, taught schod<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then practiced Iaw for 50 years in the Cornhusker state. The others are former salesmen, post office, public service and fre department employes and retired businessmen.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poundiug the pavement under a hot Missouri sun from 9:30 a. m. to 6 p. m. isn't a soft touch. Yet John P, Hart, dean of the group at 83, belicves he's in better health now than before he took the job.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never had a corn in my life,” he chuckled,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hart estimates he carries onc message every 10 minutes. The nverage walk is three blocks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's tiring work for a man 83, al- though the admission didn’t come from Hart. A ‘phone call to hi Jhonie divulged it:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mr. Hart gets home about 6:3 ‘tbut don’. call him until 7. He need:  } little rest when he gets home.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                     |
