| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a successful year, the OnlyFans creator Bryce Adams wanted to treat her employees and family members to a classic year-end corporate team-building event. She paid $38,000 to rent the Miami Marlins’ baseball stadium, prepared a nice company highlight reel for the jumbo screen and planned for everyone to take a Christmas photo on the field while wearing custom jerseys with their names on them under the phrase: “Bryceball Miami.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, on Tuesday, Adams got a call from the Marlins: Their event was canceled. Someone in the team president’s office, she was told, had gotten uncomfortable with her line of work selling explicit videos. Their big festive gathering, booked in August, was only a day away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party’s planning offered a sign of how established the industry of online content creation has become. Many influencers in the American creator economy run like small businesses, hiring workers, offering benefits packages and planning holiday parties.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sudden cancellation at  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/06/only-fans-bryce-miami-marlins-stadium/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/06/only-fans-bryce-miami-marlins-stadium/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK, Dec. 26. U.P)—The children of the Communist Party in New York were recovering, like other children, today from the ef- fects of a very happy and exciting Christmas. They had as much fun jeering at Santa Claus as other children did receiving presents which they thought he had brought to them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The celebration, which was held the Centra] Opera House, deco- rated for the occasion with an anemic pine tree and caricatures of capitalistic dignitaries, gained add- ed excitement for the romping children when the heat was turned off and most of the lights went out. A capitalistic manager of the hall was blamed for this. He said later he had been “tricked” into renting<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hall, and did not believe in giv- ing a program against San‘a Claus too much light.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children, 1,200 strong and accompanied by about 700 parents, paraded into the hal! for the party. They booed and jeered joyously when they saw the caricatures of Mayor Walker, Former Police Com- missioner Grover Whalen, President Hoover, and their hated cnemies, the police. They put on paper po- licemen's hats and knocked ‘tt.em off again with little whips. They pushed the scraggly Christmas tree ~—surrourded by a large dollar sign representing the Star of Bethie- hem—to one side and overturned it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santa Claus was disposed of at once by a song which the children bang. It ended, “they are trying to fool us.” Just then the lights went<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off stage, the girls who were to give the dance of the seven veils found the steam pipes getting cold. They shivered in silence for some time and finally decided not to dance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internationale was sung with enthusiasm and a collection was taken up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a boxing bout between “Religion” and “Science.” Every- body seemed happy when “Science”   knocked out “Religion” in the sevy- enth round. Then Religion, to show its versatility, was impersonated by @ girl who walked a tight-rope. supported on either side by “Bosses” and “Ignorance.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting ended with plenty of   denunciation for everyone. A wo- ;Man speaker wished them all a   “Revolutionary Christmas.” and   then they went home.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                          |
