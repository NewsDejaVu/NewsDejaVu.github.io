| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USDA wildlife biologists spent 10 days trapping and vaccinating animals — 753 raccoons, 41 skunks, four feral cats and one red fox — in an area about 61 miles around where the kitten was found. To attract the raccoons — and not other animals that are not reservoirs for the virus — they baited the traps with anise oil, which smells like black licorice, and marshmallows. Raccoons like the smell and taste of marshmallows, which resemble the chicken eggs they like to eat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share this article Share<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USDA, state and local officials also placed 18,000 vaccine packets in parks, along storm drains, around trees and bushes, and near walking paths in the woods in a five-mile radius. The oral rabies vaccine baits come in two-inch sachets similar to a ketchup packet and are coated with fishmeal to attract raccoons.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As they chew on it, they are bathing their mouth and tonsils with the vaccine, and that starts the immune reaction,” Chipman said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal officials have been trying to control the sp ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/11/26/rabies-kitten-omaha-raccoon/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/11/26/rabies-kitten-omaha-raccoon/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KANSAS CITY (AP)—The Mo- Kan Cat Club and its cohorts rose in voluable indignation Wed- nesday night against the City Council, which has decreed all cats in Kansas City must be licensed at $3 a year, have rabies shots and wear collars.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We could stop it with an in-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;junction in a couple of days,” suggested J. H. Sutton, ‘“‘on the basis that the collars and shots would destroy the cats. We should set a goal of several thousand dollars, hire some smart lawyers and fight this thing in the courts as high as we have to go. _ “You'd be surprised how much help we could get. There are hundreds of cat clubs in America: and they would help us, because if this tax works here it'll be tried in other cities.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs, Frank Lockery, president of the club, shushed the noisy ap-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proval of Sutton’s remarks and said she favored a direct appeal to the council before resorting to court action.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ “If everyone who owns a little kitty cat would help us, we'd have plenty of support,” she said. _ “Now I have a letter here from @ woman who says she had a friend» who put a collar on a cat last summer, and in three days it was found hanging by the collar from a tree—dead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ “And as for the rabies shots, no rabies shots have been per- fected for ca’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There's a Holder,” a woman shouted. “‘Let him tell us about the shots.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean Holder, a_ veterinarian, said he’s administered rabies shots to a lot of cats and never heard of any adverse effects.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Rabies is not the point of the ordinance,” Mrs, B, R. Shelton<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put in. “The ordinance was pas- sed to get a little money. It’s a blackmail ordinance.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They ought to innoculate the City Council for rabies,” a woman shouted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Another point in our favor,” Mrs. Lockery said, “is that cats kill rats. They kill a lot of rats every year.”   “Yeah,” a woman volunteered, “we're going to see a lot more rats in Kansas City if the cats are killed off.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We've already got a lot of rats in City Hall,” a man said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Councilman Charles W. Fisher called for order and said he would be glad to sponsor a re- pealer ordinance if he's backed up with petitions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the 65 at the meeting pressed money upon Mrs. Lockery for the campaign.
