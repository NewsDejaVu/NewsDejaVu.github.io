| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York state will spend $1 billion to expand research into chip technology in Albany, the state’s capital, with the goal of turning the region into a global center of semiconductor research and manufacturing, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced Monday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said the investment will bolster New York’s case for federal grants under the CHIPS and Science Act, which will provide more than $52 billion for semiconductor research and manufacturing. It’s part of a long-term plan wrest control of the industry away from competitors, particularly China.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There’s a race for global domination. That’s why we’re here,” Hochul, a Democrat, said at a news conference where she was joined by chip industry leaders and both of New York’s U.S. senators. “And I’m here to announce that New York state will win that race.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan will eventually create 700 new jobs and includes the purchase of a next-generation lithography machine for making computer chips, the officials said in a statement.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/semiconductor-chips-new-york-ibm-micron-9db100f002951e7ffee25b15683c3927](https://apnews.com/article/semiconductor-chips-new-york-ibm-micron-9db100f002951e7ffee25b15683c3927) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a ae eS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gov. Otto Kerner of Illinois urg- ed Midwestern states today to pool their research and political efforts to gain a greater share of space age production.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke at the first meeting of a new 12-state group, the Mid- western Governors Conference.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘We cannot be happy,” he said, “with a state of affairs that sees this region losing the scientists and engineers it trains at great cost and, with their loss, com-  pounding it by a failure to hold our own in the growth industries   of the future.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Clearly it is high time that the states of this region cooperate in their research efforts and cooper- ate in their political efforts to re- verse a tide that has been allowed to run too long against us.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerner’s speech reflected cen- cern over the fact that the bulk of federal spending for research and dvelopment is going to the West Coast and Northeast.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He said the Midwest may be thankful that it is not dependent on federal svending as California but he added:   “We cannot be happy to have ‘a small—or no—place in missiles. \the third largest industry in the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘country, or space, which bids faiz to become the equivalent in im<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;portance of the automotive indus.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trv.   If the federal contract pattern /persists, Gov. Kerner said, “‘our universities will be weakened by the failure of their territories te provide jobs for their graduates ‘and the impoverishment of _ the scientific and engineering envir- onment.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called on fellow governors lto work together to promote tour.  } ism and trade in the Midwest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   |
