| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The University of Southern California said its valedictorian will no longer deliver a graduation speech this year citing substantial risks relating to security over social media chatter surrounding the Israel-Hamas conflict. The Los Angeles school revealed that Asna Tabassum a fourth-year student from Chino Hills California was selected as the valedictorian and would give a speech alongside two salutatorians. In a news release Monday the university said she would no longer speak at the ceremony. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2024/04/15/usc-cancels-valedictorian-graduation-speech-israel-hamas/73336731007/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS After a tumultuous year on the nation’s college campuses this years commencement addresses are dominated by the theme of student unrest. One speaker sees radical students as a threat to freedom. Another says little is won by polite protest. Still another warns of a future generation of student rebels. Here are excerpts from what some prominent persons have told the graduates: President Nixon at General Beadle College in Madison S.D. - The values we cherish are laws of the community and respect for the democratic process or orderly change. The purpose of these restraints is not to protect an establishment but to establish the protection of liberty; not to prevent change but to ensure that change reflects the public — respects the rights of Mrs. Martin Luther King Jr. at Washington High School Atlanta - This is the nation which can be the epitome of democracy yet despite our advances in technology or social development we fail to create peace. You are the hope for a better world because we who are over 30 have not done too well. In you lies our hope to bring our dreams into reality. Robert H. Finch secretary of health education and welfare at the University of Southern California - Jack-booted tactics create jack-booted minds. There is too much at stake to abandon reason in the face of turmoil. We see suggestions —which I utterly oppose—for federal intervention and control for national codes of student conduct. We see this same reaction in the that would cut off all federal assistance to universities that cannot immediately quell disorder. Dr. Benjamin Spock pediatrician and antiwar activist at a rump ceremony at Queens College in New York - Anybody who has been around here for the past few years as this if you remain silent you are part of the problem. Julian Bond Negro member of the Georgia House of Representatives at the University of Bridgeport - If you think you are faced with militant young people now just see what todays 7- and 8-year-olds have waiting for you when they grow up. The campus unrest is a result of rising expectations. It is a very much American experience. This has never been an inactive nation. This has never been a nation for the timid or the fearful. He praised the motivations of young people pushing for social reform adding: If there ever was a time - we need to reason together it is now. Sen. Harold E. Hughes D-Iowa at Simpson College Indianola Iowa - Those who would disrupt our universities with acts of illegal violence must be stopped convicted and punished. But those who would disrupt our complacency and our unquestioning devotion to questionable standards should be listened to and encouraged. Sen. George McGovern D-S.D. at the University of North Carolina - We must revitalize our political parties and our political process by opening them up to the individual citizens— young and old alike and including the right to vote at 18. Unfortunately it is the naive presumption of some radicals that a violent confrontation with authority will somehow destroy authority and of course it does. |

| Maga Out-Voted | Measure Now Goes To Senate For Approval |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — The House has approved $95 billion in foreign aid for Ukraine Israel and other U.S. allies in a rare weekend session as Democrats and Republicans banded together after months of hard-right resistance over renewed American support for repelling Russia’s invasion. With an overwhelming vote Saturday the $61 billion in aid for Ukraine passed in a matter of minutes a strong showing as American lawmakers race to deliver a fresh round of U.S. support to the war-torn ally. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-aid-israel-tiktok-congress-a8910452e623413bf1da1e491d1d94ba)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts of Opponents to Alter Bill Are Voted Down. Washington — The House passed the aid-Britain bill Saturday after refusing to place a $7000000000 ceiling on the far-reaching program to lend or lease war supplies to “democracies” resisting aggression. The vote on passage was 260 to 165. The action closing a week of momentous debate before crowded galleries cleared the way for Senate discussion of the administration measure to empower President Roosevelt to transfer military equipment. A final Senate vote was not likely for three weeks. Just before final passage the House defeated 263 to 160 a motion by Rep. Fish (R-NY) to send the bill back to the Foreign Affairs Committee with instructions to substitute a $2000000000 credit for Great Britain. Democratic House leaders in an effort to gain as much support as possible accepted these limitations to the help which could be sent Britain or other countries “whose defense the President deems vital to the defense of the United States”. Existing military equipment which might be disposed of to foreign governments would be limited to $1300000000. The President could not make contracts under the program after June 30 1943 and those contracts could not run beyond June 30 1946. Congress could withdraw any of the Presidents authority under the bill by passing a concurrent resolution which would not require his signature. The bill could not be construed to authorize use of American naval vessels for convoy purposes or for entry of American ships into combat zones in violation of the neutrality act. The President would have to consult with army and navy heads before disposing of any war material and would have to report to Congress every 90 days on his actions under the program. Republicans made a long series of futile attempts to limit the program still further. They sought unsuccessfully to substitute a flat $2000000000 credit for Britain to ban use of American ports by belligerent warships and to restrict use of American soldiers to territorial waters of the Western Hemisphere. Most of the restrictions approved by the House were drafted by Democratic members of the Foreign Affairs Committee before the debate began. At the eleventh hour however administration leaders decided to insert the $1300000000 ceiling on disposition of present. |

U. S. Magistrate Patrick Malloy said Hurst stands accused of air piracy and interfering with air crew members and flight attendants. He is denied bond. Punishment upon conviction could be death. No one was injured in the ordeal. The three flight officers and four stewardesses finally scrambled from the plane in a mad dash for freedom. “We got a chance to run and we ran like hell’’ said Capt. Tom Hill pilot of the aircraft. An FBI spokesman said federal charges would be lodged today against Billy Eugene Hurst 22 of Mesquite Tex. who was arrested aboard the plane about 30 minutes after the crew had fled. Hurst had told the crew and 94 passengers that he had seven sticks of dynamite in an attache case. Only clothing and ammunition for a .22 caliber pistol which he brandished were found there later. The hijacker permitted the passengers aboard the Houston-to-Minneapolis flight to debark at Dallas and then held the crew at bay with the pistol and attache case he claimed was a bomb. “He said he disliked women and wouldn’t hesitate to kill us’’ stewardess Pat Hampton related Mrs. Hampton said the hijacker took pills throughout the six hours and 40 minutes the jetliner sat parked on a remote part of the airport. Hill said stewardess Helen Niles brought him a note from the hijacker while the plane was enroute to Dallas from Houston. The hijacker demanded a million dollars and indicated he wanted to go to South America where he planned to parachute into the jungle. Co-pilot Bill Piper radioed the control tower that Hurst wanted parachutes a jungle survival kit maps and a .357 magnum pistol brought to the grounded airliner. A reported oil leak and later engine trouble kept the plane grounded at the north end of the airport while mechanics ostensibly repaired the plane. Meanwhile a physician in the control tower radioed Mrs. Hampton to give the hijacker as much beer as he would drink. |

Even as the president spoke police continued raids which have resulted in the arrest of virtually every prominent Argentine in fields of public service. Constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech press and assembly were suspended by Wednesdays unexpected decree. Farrell promised that the state of siege will be lifted when the directive groups of the nation have shown they know how to make full use of liberty. He said the new repressive measures were brought about by an unrestrained campaign which had excited the nation. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever noticed how science fiction has this uncanny ability to make us dream about the future? Sometimes it’s hard to tell where fantasy ends and reality begins. But Chinese company XPENG AeroHT is shaking things up with something straight out of a sci-fi novel — a vehicle that’s set to turn our whole idea of travel on its head. With 2025 just around the corner we’re getting a sneak peek into what might just be the next big thing in adventure travel. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/crazy-two-in-one-electric-vehicle-comes-equipped-two-seat-aircraft-hidden-inside)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANCHORAGE Alaska (UPI) — The Curtiss-Wright Corp. one of America’s most important firms spent thousands and thousands of dollars several years of research by top scientists and the use of intricate and delicate machines to build a wheelless car that would float on air. Craig W. Vetier 17 an average American high school student with average grades spent $4 a little spare time and a conglomeration of junk including a chain saw engine an old tractor radiator fan and some plywood to do the same thing. The amazing thing is that both succeeded. Curtiss-Wright recently put its car of the future on display in New Yorks Rockefeller Center. It rose on furious jets of air swirled leaves around it and truly was a sight to behold and a credit to American industry. Young Vetter’s machine is a tremendous compliment to the ingenuity of American youth in the young state of Alaska. Vetter became interested in the air car when he read an article in a science journal on the possibility of using such a device in the army of the future. I figured there was a real need for such an invention in Alaska Craig told United Press International. It would be near perfect since it can skim over the lightest of snow and even ice. Craig’s machine which works on a five horsepower motor has undergone such successful test runs that officials at Elmendorf AFB here have permitted him the use of its workshop. |

Little did you know but you’ve become the latest victim of a ported phone number scam a devious tactic in which hackers hijack your phone number to take over your identity. What is the ported phone number scam? A CyberGuy Report subscriber contacted us to share their experience with this scam. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/cellphone-nightmare-leads-to-ported-numbers-identity-theft-and-fight-for-recovery)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (AP) — The telephone company is stepping up its fight to wipe out fraud and thievery costing it millions of dollars a year in revenue. Apparently says American Telephone & Telegraph Co. lots of people think that cheating the phone company is a sort of social game. People think that nickels and dimes are insignificant because theyre dealing with a big company but those nickels and dimes add up to dollars quickly says Francis J. Moses general security coordinator for the Bell Systems 66 million telephones. Our aim is to let people know that just as if they rob a bank they are going to get caught and be tried he adds. What forms does this fraud and thievery take? Recently a man in Ohio who felt he had been unjustly denied unemployment compensation benefits decided to do something about it. He carried his appeal to state officials and lawmakers — mostly by long distance telephone calls to Columbus. But he charged the calls to the Unemployment Compensation Bureau. This is known as toll fraud. In the last six months half a dozen operations in the East and Midwest have been wiped out. In each case the principals received prison sentences. Their business was breaking into pay phone coin boxes. Moses a 6-foot 200-pound former Villanova University football player who looks the part of a security agent estimated Bell System losses of cash stolen from its million pay phones and damage to the instruments at nearly $5 million a year. Five years ago the loss wasnt much above $750000. |
