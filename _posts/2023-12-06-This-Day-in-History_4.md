And another year of frustration, especially for veterans such as defensive tackle Jonathan Allen, who said this week he thinks about playing elsewhere.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I would love to win here for sure, but I want to win, first and foremost,” Allen said on 106.7 the Fan on Monday. “So that’s always going to be at the front and center of my mind, and everything I’m going to be doing in my career is going to make sure I’ll have an opportunity to win.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third quarter of the Commanders’ season, which we’re defining as Weeks 9 through 13, things fell apart. It started well, with a win in New England, then ended with four straight losses and the firing of defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio and a defensive assistant.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s look back at the failures and try to answer these questions: What can be fixed, and wha ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/06/commanders-season-fell-apart/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/06/commanders-season-fell-apart/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- GETTYSBURG, Pa., Nov. 30 # — President Eisenhower marked up additional headway today to- ward recovery from a mild stroke —with the Army-Navy football game on television as a personally prescribed tonic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander in chief of the armed forces went through the customary motions of neutrality, then gathered old friends around him and rooted for Army from start to finish. ;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as he. went through an<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise quiet day of recupera- tion at his country estate, Eisen- hower’s doctor, Maj.
