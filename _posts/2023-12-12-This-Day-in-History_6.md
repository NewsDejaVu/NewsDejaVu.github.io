The order came in response to a challenge from civil rights advocates opposed to the voting districts in Galveston County. While the case involves the boundaries in just one locality, it could have broader implications for challenges to election maps and the protection of voting rights nationwide.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is customary with emergency applications, the Supreme Court majority did not explain its rationale for leaving the map in place for now.

Clark, a Texan, joined in today's action, ‘‘But upon the grounds stated in his separate opinion’’ in the Su- preme Court's decision two weeks ego in a_ congressional districting case in Georgia.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court said in that case that congressional districts must represent the same num- ber of voters, so far as is prac- ticable.  |
