| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK (AP) — The Associated Press says it is setting up a sister organization that will seek to raise money in support of state and local news reporting as the crisis in that sector shows little sign of abating. The organization which will have a board of directors independent of the AP will solicit philanthropic spending to boost this news coverage both within the AP and through outside organizations the news outlet said Tuesday. “We feel we have to lean in at this point not pull back.” ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/reporters-local-ap-foundations-c2c3fced7b46e7f0a6e0ebe6773fde4a)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP)—A controversial request for federal funds to publish a weekly newspaper for the poor in western North Carolina is not likely to win approval from the antipoverty agency sources indicated today. In the past the Office of Economic Opportunity has refused to fund a newspaper project because as one official said last year ‘there are serious doubts as to the propriety of federal funding of a commercial newspaper. The OEO has however given funds to local community action agencies which have used part of the money to print mimeographed newsletters explaining antipoverty programs and giving other information. This is particularly true on Indian reservations. The North Carolina controversy arose when WAMY Community Action Inc. local antipoverty organization in the counties of Watauga Avery Mitchell and Yancey requested $179000 to begin a weekly newspaper. The proposal dated April 11 said the funds also would be used to present a daily hour-long radio program over local commercial stations. When the request was made public North Carolina congressmen and the Asheville N.C. Citizen criticized the proposal. This project is unnecessary unrealistic unwise and un-American said Rep. Roy A. Taylor D-N.C. It is an insult to America’s newspapers big and small and to the American free enterprise system. It is a step toward federally financed and controlled press. An OEO spokesman said the request had been received here but no action had been taken on it. Informed sources indicated the project would not receive federal approval because the similar request 14 years ago — the only other such proposal received — was turned down. The OEO at that time told University Neighborhood Council a Washington community action agency it could not approve its request for $150000 because the project is not sufficiently innovative. The agency also said it does not seem the essentially conventional approach of a weekly newspaper will provide the answers to — or even research into — the many unknowns of ‘communication.’ At the time the American Newspaper Publishers Association protested any government subsidy of a newspaper as a matter of fundamental principle. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LA PAZ Bolivia (AP) — Led by a top general vowing to “restore democracy” armored vehicles rammed the doors of Bolivia’s government palace Wednesday in what the president called a coup attempt then quickly retreated — the latest crisis in the South American country facing a political battle and an economic crisis. Within hours the nation of 12 million people saw a rapidly moving scenario in which the troops seemed to take control of the government of President Luis Arce.

Henrique Teixeira Lott ousted provisional President Carlos Coimbra Da Luz and took over the government early today. The navy and air force refused to support the army coup and issued a joint statement pledging loyalty to Luz. A few hours later the fashionable Copacabana beach section was rocked by cannon fire from Copacabana fort. Witnesses said the forts big guns were fired across the bow of a warship heading out of the harbor and that the ship turned back. Army units commanded by generals took over central police headquarters and the office of the mayor in the capital and issued an order closing all stores at noon. Other units surrounded government buildings the radio station the post office and several newspaper buildings. Lott issued a communique claiming support of the president of the supreme court the presidents of both houses of Congress and most army officers in Rio De Janeiro and the interior. Luz was rumored to have taken refuge aboard the navy cruiser Barrosa but other reports said he and several Cabinet ministers had been arrested. The navy ministry was surrounded by armed marines with field pieces spotted strategically nearby. A heavy rain fell on the capital and the center of the city was quiet although tension was apparent. Much of the fleet was caught in the harbor when the navy announced its opposition to the coup by the army and several ships began maneuvering toward the exits of Guanabara Bay. Only one it was reported succeeded in slipping out. The others were under the guns of Copacabana fort at the south end of the famous beach and Leme fort at the north. Army and navy leaders met in hurried conferences with Navy Minister Amorim Do Valle. The minister was believed trying to reconcile the two branches of the armed forces. The House of Deputies lower house of the Brazilian Congress met late in the morning in special session to decide legally the fate of the Luz government. It was clear most of the deputies support Lott but his opponents were allowed to speak freely. The first speaker was Joao Agripino of the National Democratic Union party who assailed Lott’s seizure of the government in violent terms. But he was followed by other speakers who defended Lott as a true supporter of constitutional government. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Friday limited a federal obstruction law that has been used to charge hundreds of Capitol riot defendants as well as former President Donald Trump. The justices ruled 6-3 that the charge of obstructing an official proceeding enacted in 2002 in response to the financial scandal that brought down Enron Corp. must include proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents. Only some of the people who violently attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 2021 were charged under this law. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-capitol-riot-obstruction-2cdba47baa5cea8177d651de751760a6)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — Civil rights pickets swarmed onto Pennsylvania Avenue on Friday and sprawled on the pavement in front of the White House. They sang and struggled as police carried them away. It was the second time in two days that the Southern civil rights tactic of civil disobedience had been aimed at the White House by demonstrators demanding that President Johnson send federal forces to Selma Ala. Johnson was quoted as declaring he would not be blackjacked by pickets into any hasty action in the racially torn Southern city. The President a clergyman said promised to do what he regards as right. Hundreds of civil rights pickets circled all day on the broad sidewalk in front of the White House. And some 4000 churchmen from all over the nation rallied near the Capital to underscore their demand for legislation to guarantee Negro voting rights and for measures to protect civil rights demonstrators in Selma. Johnson scheduled a news conference for Saturday afternoon with the voting rights measure expected to be his major topic. Atty. Gen. Nicholas Katzenbach said he hopes to have a suggested message to Congress on voting rights ready for the President by Saturday afternoon. He said the message might go to Congress early next week But Katzenbach indicated there is no plan now to send new federal manpower to Selma. He said more than 75 government lawyers and FBI agents are there already. “We would hope that the presence there would be adequate” he said. It was a day of tension and a clergyman who saw Johnson said the President seemed to be feeling the pressure. A band of youthful demonstrators walked into the White House as tourists Thursday sat down on the floor and demanded a talk with Johnson. Police broke up that demonstration after almost seven hours. Ten demonstrators were arrested. A short-lived sit-down demonstration that blocked a main entrance driveway at the White House prefaced the action on Pennsylvania Avenue. The trouble came at the height of the evening traffic rush. |

(AP) — Firemen fought Wednesday in hills rimming this picturesque seaside community to check a fire that has destroyed an estimated 15 homes and could imperil estates in the wealthy suburb of Montecito. The blaze was the newest in a rash of forest and brush fires that have run wild in California since Sunday night. In Northern California where others are located the situation looked better. Major fires in the wine country around Calistoga and Sonoma were reported controlled but an extension of the Sonoma fire flared up near Napa and a new brush fire was reported 200 miles farther north in the Eureka area. In the Santa Barbara area 1000 firefighters fought to keep the 2100-acre blaze from lush canyons with mansions on the slopes of the Santa Ynez Mountains north of Montecito. Winds up to 45 miles an hour whipped the fire after it started from an undetermined cause Tuesday. Thirteen persons reportedly suffered injuries including four firemen one of whom was hospitalized with burns on his face and hands. The four vainly battled to keep the fire from jumping Mountain Drive minutes after it started. Most of the destroyed homes were on Mountain Drive. Santa Barbara a coastal community of some 60000 persons was not in danger but officials kept their fingers crossed that the wind would not change. Also escaping the fire was Westmont College from which 600 students were evacuated Tuesday night. Gov. Edmund G. Brown flew to Northern California Tuesday to inspect the fires there saw the Santa Barbara fire on his way back to Los Angeles and termed it ‘a terrible sight’. The fires north of San Francisco blackened more than 62400 acres of watershed. Fifty homes and 7000 acres were burned Monday in Calistoga. That fire was reported controlled. More than 100 homes and other buildings have been destroyed in Northern California fires including about 20 homes in the Sonoma fire also reported controlled. |

Coya Knutson (D-Minn) won nomination for a third term Wednesday in the face of her husbands campaign to keep her out of politics. Her victory came amid a tide of Democratic votes that appeared headed for a record party high in the Minnesota primary. The 45-year-old congresswoman was running about 4000 votes ahead of businessman Marvin Evenson of Moorhead with returns in from all but a handful of the 9th District’s 641 precincts. Informed of his wifes triumph Andrew Knutson a hotel operator in Oklee Minn. hinted he might relent and support her in the general election against farmer-legislator Odin Langen. Knutson allied himself with his wife’s opponents inside the Democratic party this summer after she refused his pleas to quit Washington and return home. Mrs. Knutson’s victory was the narrowest for a party organization that brought out a vote which promised to top the previous Democratic mark of 351000 in 1954. All Democratic endorsees and all but one or two Republican-backed candidates were nominated by their parties in Tuesdays primary. But in nearly every race Democrats who now control five of nine congressional seats one Senate seat and most state offices far outdistanced Republican candidates. Despite opposition from former Gov. Hjalmar Petersen 42-year-old Rep. Eugene McCarthy (D-Minn) was nearly 40000 votes ahead of Republican Sen. Edward Thye whose seat he will seek in November with returns in from 3218 of 3755 precincts. Democratic Gov. Orville Freeman seeking a third term was running 100000 votes ahead of the Republican nominee George MacKinnon former U.S. district attorney. Seven incumbent House members won renomination — Mrs. Knutson John Blatnik Fred Marshall and Roy Wier for the Democrats and Walter Judd H. Carl Andersen and Albert Quie for the Republicans. |
