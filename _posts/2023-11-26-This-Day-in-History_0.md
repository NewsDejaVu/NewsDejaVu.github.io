| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GENEVA (AP) — As he sits in Geneva, Michel Dreifuss does not feel all that far away from the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7 and Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza. The ripples are rolling through Europe and upending assumptions both global and intimate — including those about his personal safety as a Jew.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yesterday I bought a tear-gas spray canister at a military-equipment surplus store,” the 64-year-old retired tech sector worker said recently at a rally to mark a month since the Hamas killings. The choice, he says, is a “precaution,” driven by a surge of antisemitism in Europe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month’s slayings of about 1,200 people in Israel by armed Palestinian militants represented the biggest killing of Jews since the Holocaust. The fallout from it, and from Israel’s intense military response that health officials in Hamas-controlled Gaza say has killed at least 13,300 Palestinians, has extended to Europe. In doing so, it has shaken a continent all too familiar with deadly anti-Jew ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-antisemitism-europe-massacre-war-protests-1d26266dfd9b2b8dd4c795f420abab47](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-antisemitism-europe-massacre-war-protests-1d26266dfd9b2b8dd4c795f420abab47) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RY VA £ AU AEG s es<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spokesman for the militants holding the U.S. captives in Tehran said today an attack by neighboring Iraq would leave the American hostages ‘“‘in grave danger’’ because “Iraq is a puppet of America.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The American people must stand before President Carter and not allow him to attack Iran or we will be forced to destroy the hostages,’ said the spokesman, identified only as Habib.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is an alert for America,”’ the militant told the NBC television pro- gram Today. “An attack by Iraq, which would act only on orders from America, would leave the hostages in grave danger.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new threat came as Iran and Iraq inched closer to full-scale war, with Iran claiming to have beaten off Iraqi air attacks and destroying a military base in fighting along the Moslem nations’ common border.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the second time in as many days the militants had threatened to kill the hostages if the United States carries out any military operation against Iran.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The militant spokesman denied it was a crime to hold the Americans for more than five months in the occupied U.S. Embassy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Tt is only for the purpose of show- ing the crimes of America,” he said. “They will not be released until the return of the criminal shah and the stolen wealth of our nation,” he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It is only President Carter who is oppressing the hostages,” he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iranian television earlier broadcast a film showing what it said were two of the captives describing espionage ac- tivities by the occupied U.S. Embassy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The midnight broadcast came hours after the militants holding the em- bassy threatened to kill the hostages,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in their 159th day of captivity, if the United States took the ‘“‘slightest’’ military action against Iran.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a banner headline story today, the Islamic Republic newspaper an- nounced a march Friday in Tehran by members of Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho- meini’s popular “‘army of 20 million”’ — a term used for all those opposed to the release of the hostages.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The nation will renew its pledge tomorrow to defend the Koran and Iran,”’ the newspaper, organ of the rul- ing clerical group, said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The march appeared to have a dual role because of the U.S. reprisals for the hostage crisis and recent border clashes between Iran and Iraq.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two supposed hostages on the film spoke English, but their names and some of their statments were made inaudible by a Persian language narration, the Washington Post and other American newspapers reported.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the telecast, one of the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hostages, who had dark hair and was wearing glasses and camouflage pants, displayed what the television said was electronic monitoring equip- ment in a supply depot on the embassy compound. The other man, who had blond hair and wore a V-neck sweater, showed a photograph of an alleged spy plane. He spoke to two militants in a room witha door marked ‘‘Defense Attache.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broadcast made no mention of when the film was made.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American officials denied the Ira- nian television report and said the equipment probably was standard radio and telephone communications equipment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Iranian officials recently said spy trials for the hostages have not been ruled out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, Iranian Foreign Minister<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadegh Ghotbzadeh said he favored having relatives of the hostages visit them in the occupied embassy and that he would bring the question up to the Revolutionary Council.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was was countered by the militants who said, ‘There is no need for other people to visit.”’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the militants appears more secure since Khomeini ruled that they, and not the government, would have custody of the hostages until the not yet formed parliament decided the captives’ fate in two or three months time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Khomeini’s announcement Monday prompted President Carter to an-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nounce a number of sanctions against Iran, including the severing of diplomatic relations and a trade em- bargo.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-U.S feeling is being further in- tensified in Iran by official pro- nouncements that the troubles with neighboring Iraq are Washington’s do- ing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghotbzadeh, who had previously been in the ranks of those seeking a diplomatic solution to the hostage crisis, described Iraq as ‘‘an American puppet,’’ linking the tension between the two countries and the hostage crisis.  |
