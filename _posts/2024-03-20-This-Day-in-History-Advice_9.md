| Girlfriend Of Three Years Learns The Horrible Truth | Shall We Open Up Or Run For Cover? |
|  |  |
| Abigail Van Buren for the Uexpress | News Wire Article published in the Coshocton Tribune |
| February 19, 2024 | January 24, 1966 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For nearly three years I have been seeing a man who later asked me to move in with him. He abruptly stopped emailing me four months ago. I waited several weeks and then emailed him telling him how upset and hurt I was and asking what was going on. I found out -- not from him -- that he has been in a relationship with another woman for the last five years. I am furious! I am at a loss about what I should do. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.uexpress.com/life/dearabby/2024/02/19)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man I used to know very well is a cross between a monkey and a donkey (which is the polite way of saying it). He mooched off me for three years even fed him when he was too cheap to take me out for dinner. He embarrassed me at parties with his high-jinks and I do mean “high!” And he thought he was the answer to a woman’s prayer. Well I put up with it and when he got ready to dump me he didn’t even have the decency to let me know. I just saw him with another woman asked around and found he’d moved in with her. Well I can tell her some things about him that would curl her fake eyelashes. I’m about to write her a letter and spill it all. Why not let her know she didn’t get any bargain?—GLAD HE’S GONE. Dear GHG: “Pin the tales on the donkey” is for kids. If you want him back backbiting is no way to get him. If youre REALLY glad he’s gone why get in a snit because he dumped you first? Shrug smile and circulate!—H. |

| The Ethicist: Is Shoplifting Ok If The Shop Owner Is Awful? | Ways To Help Break Up Shoplifting |
|  |  |
| Kwame Anthony Appiah for the New York Times Magazine | News Wire Article published in the Biloxi Daily Herald |
| February 16, 2024 | October 26, 1972 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A close friend of many years whom I’ve always thought of as an extremely honest ethical person recently confided in me that she shoplifts on a regular basis. She explained that she never steals from small or independently owned businesses only from large companies and only when no small business nearby carries the items she needs. She targets companies that are known to treat their employees badly or that knowingly source their products from places where human rights are violated or whose ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/magazine/shoplifting-friend-ethics.html)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Sir: Mr. Manager Mr. and Mrs. Consumer shoplifting is on the upswing in the Morgantown area. This problem rests on the shoulders of all of us. We all suffer and pay for it in this time of inflation and higher prices. Shoplifting losses run an estimated $2 billion a year which in most cases is passed on to the consumer through higher prices. Most of our Morgantown store managers don’t even call a law enforcement officer when a shoplifting is caught. Some of their excuses are: ‘We don’t have time to go to court It’s easier to scold them and let them go. We don’t want to make their parents mad and lose their business.’ We even have people who say we don’t have shoplifters in Morgantown! I don’t believe this and neither does Mr. Chambers manager of Hills Department Store. He is one of only a few Morgantown managers who doesn’t close his eyes and who does prosecute shoplifters. It would be much easier to just turn your head and tack on a few more cents on another item to cover the loss suffered. This is done by managers more than often and it is once again Mr. and Mrs. Consumer who takes the beating. The store’s manager doesn’t lose one nickel out of his pocket. How long do you think it takes for word to get around that a certain store is easy for the taking or stay away from a certain store unless you like the accommodations of the county jail. The question is how do we control this menace? I dont pretend to know all of the answers but these suggestions would be steps in the right direction: We must urge all managers to prosecute; courts must hand down stiffer penalties; stores must keep neat displays so a missing item will be noted; plan low layouts; keep jewelry and other small items hooked to displays; beware of groups of teenagers especially when they begin creating a disturbance; watch customers with clothes too large for them check the big parcels and suitcases. Always look and keep looking. The biggest weapon of all is courteous prompt service by sales personnel. Nothing scares a booster more than a clerk galloping down on him calling out ‘Can I help you sir?’ - Robert H. McIntire Morgantown |

| My In-Laws Gave Gifts To Two Grandchildren But Not To A Third. Help! | Dear Abby: Preventing Misuse Of Gifts |
|  |  |
| Philip Galanes for The New York Times Social Q’S | News Wire Article published in the Bridgeport Telegram |
| March 20, 2024 | March 24, 1967 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago my in-laws gave our oldest child and another grandchild generous monetary gifts when they turned 13 in the same year. The other grandchild had a bar mitzvah that year but we’re not religious so our child did not. Still they both received checks. Our second child turned 13 two years ago but she received no such gift. My husband and I think this was an oversight. We don’t believe his parents meant to favor one child over another. Should my husband mention this to them? ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/style/in-laws-gifts-grandchildren.html)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Abby: I have written this letter in hopes that other thoughtless teenagers will wake up before its too late. Thanks Abby for letting me get this off my chest. D.D.H.: SAN DIEGO. I have nine grandchildren. I send each one a check for five dollars on his birthday as well as at Christmas. I am distressed. One mother signs her childrens checks cashes them and keeps the money herself. The children do not even know that I have sent them a gift. Very soon a birthday is due. I love these children my social security is small but I still want to send these children money. How can I prevent the mother from grabbing it? The children are junior and high school students. GRANDMA. If you can give the children the CASH personally do so. If you must mail your gift conceal the five-dollar bill in a card and ask each child to let you know how he has spent it. |

| March 20, 2024 | March 18, 1968 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a friend who is very social and who grew up in the area where we all now live. Whenever we meet he soon starts giving me details about who has died as well as the funerals he’s attended. I’ve told him: “I’m not interested! I don’t know these people.” Should I let it go or am I being rude? FRIEND I would tread lightly here. Telling a person that you feel no compassion for the loss of his old friends is callous.

| Philip Galanes for The New York Times Social Q’S | News Wire Article published in the Cullman Times Democrat |
| March 20, 2024 | March 19, 1972 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My partner and I moved to a beautiful European city a few years ago. We have several visitors from home every year. Our apartment doesn’t have much guest space though. There is one small guest room with a twin bed and desk (which I use as my office). When we have single guests we invite them to stay with us. When we have couples we suggest a hotel and sometimes offer to pay for it. The problem: A couple has asked to visit us. These are people who are willing to sleep on sofas floors — anywhere. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/style/in-laws-gifts-grandchildren.html)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Ann Landers: Your column No Guest Room brought back some bitter memories. When I was growing up we had a flock of relatives who came to visit from out of town. Mother thought my bedroom was the nicest in the house so I got moved out for everyone who came. How I hated it! Company to me was a dirty word. And it still is. I made up my mind that when I had a home of my own I would never have sleep-over guests. Weve been married 18 years next month and Ive kept my vow. We have no guest room and our living room has two love seats instead of a sofa. (In every family there is someone who says Oh dont worry about me I can sleep on the couch.) Perhaps I sound anti-social but my attitude is the result of having been kicked out of my own room so often when I was a child I also might tell you that it created feelings of hostility against some of my relatives. So you see Ann there are two sides to every question. Print my side will you? P.S. When I visit relatives I stay in a hotel or a motel. — Familiarity Breeds Contempt Dear Fam: Heres your side but perhaps you should consider a cot for a guest in an emergency. Thanks for writing. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite having moved to my current area 40 years ago I retain the regional accent of my youth. The problem: A woman in my book club mimics me! She is clearly making fun of me which I find embarrassing and rude. I ignore her but I’m thinking of dropping out of the group. What should I do? J. I’m sorry your feelings are hurt and I understand why they are. Still you are a grown-up. Tell this woman directly that you dislike her mimicry and want it to stop.

She lived with her younger brother and his family who were all college graduates. They found her way of speaking amusing and would often laugh at her even in front of guests. The woman wondered if she should feel flattered or resentful. Abby advised her to express her feelings to her family as they might not be aware of how she felt. Abby also addressed other letters including one from a mother concerned about her daughters thick black sideburns and another from a family struggling with neighbors overusing their swimming pool. Abbys advice was generally to communicate openly and respect individuality. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEAR ABBY: I recently started planning my wedding. Half the friends I want as bridesmaids are very conservative. They think sex is sacred and should be talked about only discreetly not joked about mentioned on TV etc. I used to hold similar views but I no longer do. Neither do the other half of the girls I want as bridesmaids. My dream bachelorette party is the kind you see in movies a group of girls going out on the town getting tipsy -- maybe being a little stupid -- nothing dangerous. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.uexpress.com/life/dearabby/2024/03/20)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Abigail Van Buren: Doug and I plan to announce our engagement next Sunday and I know this girl is going to bring up the matter of being a bridesmaid again. I intend to have my very close friends for my bridesmaids but I hate to hurt this girl’s feelings. I talked it over with Doug and he said he wouldnt be offended if I told her no. But how can I tell her and keep peace in the family? HATES TO HURT. Tell her the truth that you are having your closest friends for your bridesmaids. Period. CONFIDENTIAL TO ROLLIE IN DES MOINES: Yes a rooster does have a male organ but it is very small. I suppose a hen would submit that it is adequate for her needs but by human standards it’s nothing to crow about. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEAR ABBY: I just found out my husband has been texting with his high school sweetheart for the last three years. He contacted her and shares all day-to-day activities like our vacations new dog etc. She lives 2500 miles away. Shes divorced retired like us and has children and grandchildren. I snooped and read his email. I can tell by her responses that she is being polite.

So my husband strayed helped along by a sweet young thing who turned his head. I didn’t picket or march. I took stock. I faced myself squarely and saw that had I been in his shoes I might have looked elsewhere for companionship. We talked it out. It isn’t easy putting aside the hurt but when you know that your man is basically good just human you can. Now our marriage is stronger than ever. Unlike the woman who described her fears and miseries every time the door bell rings or the mail comes (thinking it will be news of a new infidelity) I’m now secure in my love and sure of my man. I am 43 my husband is 46. Lately Ive noticed a lady... |

| Baby Shower Invite Doubles As Fundraiser | Shower Gifts Dilemma |

| Abigail Van Buren for the Dear Abby For Uexpress | News Wire Article published in the Monroe News Star |
| March 20, 2024 | February 24, 1969 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEAR ABBY: I recently received an Evite to a surrogate baby shower. I was happy to attend. Each guest was asked to bring a box of diapers our favorite childrens book and a donation to help cover the surrogate expenses. A written explanation of how expensive the surrogate process is was also included. In my opinion when the couple started the surrogacy process they were aware of how expensive it would be and to ask the shower attendees to contribute to it is a little nervy. Was this proper etiquette? ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.uexpress.com/life/dearabby/2024/03/20)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEAR MISS VANDERBILT My friend just miscarried and the doctor has told her that it is unlikely that she will ever have another baby. Recently there was a baby shower for her and she has many gifts. Her dilemma is this: should she return the gifts to the givers with a note of explanation or should she keep them? — Mrs. R. T. Nashville Tenn. Many a young woman has been told that she may never have another baby and she has gone on to have several successfully. Even where future pregnancy is not advised some couples do of course adopt children. I think it would sadden the girls friends to have their gifts returned to them. I suggest that she keep them as an augury of the future.
