| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are considered children under state law its chief justice had a higher authority in mind. By citing verses from the Bible and Christian theologians in his concurring opinion Chief Justice Tom Parker alarmed advocates for church-state separation while delighting religious conservatives who oppose abortion. Human life Parker wrote “cannot be wrongfully destroyed without incurring the wrath of a holy God who views the destruction of H ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/alabama-frozen-embryos-conservative-christian-views-ruling-d9b7f720b5ef865ab35205ad36061f2d)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (UPI) - Lawyers for the state of Texas defending their anti-abortion law contended before the Supreme Court today that life begins with conception and from that instant on the unborn fetus is a person as far as constitutional rights are concerned. At issue is a law on the books in Texas and 30 other states which makes abortion a crime unless it is necessary to save the mothers life. On the opposite issue was Mrs. Sarah Weddington of Austin Texas representing a group of citizens trying to get the law overturned. She told the nine black-robed justices that lower court rulings have so far indicated a fetus should not be considered a person with rights equal to all others. Both lawyers were questioned continually from the bench. The touchy abortion issue was put aside last year when the Court was short by two members. Todays arguments involved a Texas statute which makes abortion a crime unless it is necessary to save the mothers life. A three-judge federal panel in Dallas ruled in June 1970 that the statute is unconstitutional but did not bar its enforcement. A Dallas group has brought a challenge arguing that a Texas district attorney is continuing to enforce the law. A Georgia law which allows abortion for some reasons such as rape or the possibility of a physical or mental defect in the child. The statute is being challenged by a group including pregnant women both single and married physicians registered nurses ministers and social workers. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than two weeks before Aaron Bushnell walked toward the gates of the Israeli Embassy on Sunday he and a friend talked by phone about their shared identities as anarchists and what kinds of risks and sacrifices were needed to be effective. Bushnell 25 mentioned nothing violent or self-sacrificial the friend said. Then on Sunday Bushnell texted that friend who described the exchange on the condition of anonymity to protect his safety. “I hope you’ll understand. I love you” Bushnell wrote. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/02/26/israeli-embassy-airman-fire-death-gaza/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP)—A self-proclaimed pacifist his baby in his arms turned himself into a human torch outside the Pentagon Tuesday as a horrified crowd of homegoing workers watched. He died shortly afterward. The onlookers shouted for the man to drop the 18-month-old baby girl Emily one of his three children and he did so. She escaped injury. The man was identified as Norman R. Morrison 31 of Baltimore Md. a Quaker. This sect formally called the Society of Friends disapproves of war or violence of any form and has urged nonviolence between nations. Several notes were found in Morrison’s pockets but a spokesman for Pentagon security police said he did not know if there was a suicide note. One paper seems to be notes taken at an Oct. 12 meeting of the ‘Friends Joint Peace Committee’ at Goucher College Center in Baltimore. They included the phrase “ordeal of peace in two worlds” and reference to the ratio of civilians killed in Viet Nam. Morrison and the baby were rushed to the Ft. Myer hospital not far from the Pentagon. He was declared dead on arrival. Several hours later Morrison’s wife Ann arrived from Baltimore. A hospital spokesman said Mrs. Morrison declined to talk with reporters and would return to Baltimore with the child. The General Service Administration and the U.S. district attorney’s office were investigating the reasons for the spectacular suicide. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COLUMBIA S.C. (AP) — The first federal trial over a hate crime based on gender identity began Tuesday in South Carolina where a man faces charges that he killed a Black transgender woman and then fled to New York. The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that in August 2019 Daqua Lameek Ritter lured the woman — who is referred to as Dime Doe in court documents — into driving to a sparsely populated rural county in South Carolina. Ritter then shot her three times in the head with a .22 caliber ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://apnews.com/article/hate-crime-south-carolina-transgender-woman-c7d2970b6c2658c1e711fa15e5777ab4)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IOWA CITY IA March 17 - The prosecution today accused Robert Bednasek 24 a University of Iowa psychology student of having a sexual interest in his campus sweetheart and killing her at a secret party because he felt he was losing her. Bednasek broke down and cried as Special Prosecutor Edward Rate made the accusation in his opening statement at Bednaseks trial for the murder of Margaret Gee Gee Jackson 20. Rate claimed that Bednaseks interest in Jackson was more than a typical campus romance. He suggested that Bednaseks infatuation and sexual interest had led him to a state of mind where he believed if he couldnt have her no one else could. Rate told the jury that the evidence would prove Bednasek guilty of first-degree murder the highest crime known to God. He did not request the death penalty but asked the jury to determine a suitable punishment. Rate stated that Jacksons friendship with Bednasek had ended before her death on December 11 and that she found him distasteful. He added that Jackson had started dating other men and their relationship had been deteriorating since the previous summer. Rate also mentioned that before Jackson went on a trip to Denver last summer she returned Bednaseks fraternity pin to his parents. When Bednasek followed her to Denver their friendship ended. |

| Uncomfortable Reality Leads To Vision Pro Returns | Built-In Mania Is Great Curse Of Modern Age |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent reports indicate a wave of returns for Apples Vision Pro headsets with users citing discomfort headaches and eye strain as primary concerns. This uptick in returns aligns with the closing of Apples 14-day return window suggesting initial excitement for the $3500 device may be waning. The clunky design of the headset has been a critical factor for users. The front-heavy weight distribution has been linked to physical discomfort with some users experiencing headaches and motion sickness. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/uncomfortable-reality-leads-to-vision-pro-returns)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the bustling age. Nobody any longer wants anything unless it is also guaranteed to have at least a couple of other features built into it. This goes for practically everything from brassieres to bookcases from three-color ice cream to cigarette boxes that play Yankee Doodle when opened. If it doesnt have that built-in something extra it’s strictly twenty-three skiddoo. Even the pigeons turn up their beaks at popcorn today unless it contains three kinds of built-in vitamins. Think Im kidding? Well over in Glasgow theyve just developed a blouse with built-in perfume. Makes a girl smell sweet in any flavor she wants for months and months. But this international craze to build something into something else probably has reached its true flower in the motor car and household gadget industries. An automobile used to be a vehicle to get you from here to there. But now cars are gradually taking the place of the old fashioned home. You can shave in them listen to a concert smoke carry on a long distance telephone conversation with Paris or push a button and slice your mother-in-law in half with an automatic sliding window. About the only thing you cant do in them is play a tuba. Take what happened to the simple broom. It used to be a straightforward instrument for gathering dust out of odd corners. Then they turned it into a carpet sweeper. Then it developed into the vacuum cleaner. And what wont it do now? It can paint walls wax floors dry the baby manicure the furniture and shampoo your rug or your dog or your wife. In another year itll serve meals fight peddlers attack poisonous snakes and play you gin rummy for keeps. Furniture has become so complicated by built-in gadgets that you cant even tell its function from an outside look. Soon we’ll have to hang an index on each piece to know all it is capable of. Youll have to approach it by radar. As it is now I always have a moment of fear when a host asks me to pull open or stop at a new cabinet in the living room. I never know whether the thing will dump a sack of laundry on the floor spray me with martinis or just show another television wrestling match from Chicago. Yes its all confused. You dial a telephone and someone complains youre turning off the air-conditioning unit. Are we living at peace in the built-in war or dwelling at war in a built-in peace? Call a sociopolitical adviser. The plane of living no longer offers any escape. I met a friend emerging from one the other day and he said with a dazed look What a few slot machine they got in there! I put in a nickel. And what happened? Why the darn thing rang up a 1000000 score shot off three Roman candles weighed me shined my shoes told my fortune played a Bing Crosby record and reached into my pocket for another nickel. Don’t go in there pal. I bet if Id put in a quarter the thing would probably have married me moved into my apartment and set up housekeeping. There is only one way to beat the built-in age. Thats to stave off the race with some built-in common sense. Who really wants a fountain pen that will write letters brush his teeth take his passport photo and — for fifty cents extra — have three knife blades and a bottle opener at one end? |

| Verification Scams Hitting Elon Musk’S X After Changing Former Twitter Check Marks | Talking Computer Blocks Bogus Credit Card Calls |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X – formerly known as Twitter – has gone through more than a name change since it switched over. One of these has been with the account verification process. You know that little blue check mark that certain profiles have that indicates it\s verified. Without that blue check mark it can be difficult to contact other people on X get through certain groups and essentially use the platform to the fullest. It\s no surprise that this little blue check mark has spurred a lot of controversy. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/verification-scams-hitting-elon-musks-x-after-changing-former-twitter-check-marks)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A computer programmed to say “no” in a feminine voice has been enlisted by the telephone company to stop fraudulent credit card calls. The computer in a secret location in California has prevented completion of some 80000 bogus credit card calls since it began tipping off operators in January says Ben Dial assistant vice president for operations at Pacific Telephone Co. The only equipment of its kind in the United States the computer was developed to combat a mounting credit card fraud problem in California. “We had an immense amount of credit card fraud last year— about half a million dollars worth a month” he said. “This machine will put a stop to it” he said. When a credit card call is placed the operator key-punches the card number into the computer circuit. If the number checks out the operator hears a recorded female voice say: “Okay.” If the number is a phony the voice says: “No” repeats the number and says “No” again. The process takes 22 seconds. A caller who gives a false card number is offered the option of paying for the call or hanging up. Pacific Telephone was hit with a surge of credit card fakery in 1971 when underground newspapers published suggestions for making up credit card numbers. Bogus calls worth $6 million were placed mostly at coin telephones. “We had to stop it at the source because once a fraudulent call is placed you don’t find out about it for some time Dial said. The computer check is centered generally around Hollywood and the larger universities where most of the phony calls occur. “California in fact accounted for half the fraudulent credit card calls in the country last year he said. “There may be some people who feel that real money is not involved” he said. “But it’s just as real as robbing a bank.” Dial said Pacific Telephone would not reveal the location of the computer for security reasons. |
