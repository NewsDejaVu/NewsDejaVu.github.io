| In A Scorching Year Scientists Wonder If Climate Change Is Speeding Up | Latest Earthshaking Events Hardly Unnerve Scientists |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past several years a small group of scientists has warned that sometime early this century the rate of global warming — which has remained largely steady for decades — might accelerate. Temperatures could rise higher faster. The drumbeat of weather disasters may become more insistent. And now after what is poised to be the hottest year in recorded history the same experts believe that it is already happening. In a paper published last month climate scientist James E. Hansen and a ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/26/global-warming-accelerating-climate-change/)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wave of earthquakes volcanic eruptions and other natural calamities around earth this year is the highest since 1970 but scientists don\t think it is a signal the end of the world is near. Seismologists among them experts at renowned institutes in Sweden the United States Japan Italy and the Philippines disagree as to whether the activity is unusual or if one cataclysm triggers another. Mixed Weather Patterns Mix in some strange weather patterns and one could be forgiven for thinking all is not well. Japan is having cool spells in mid-summer normally damp Britain is in a severe drought which has hit Western Europe to a lesser degree and in Eastern Europe temperatures are lower and rain higher than normal. The London Meteorological Office says there\s no cause for alarm because projections show no significant change in weather conditions. And the Japan Meteorological Agency says the possibility that it may be colder than usual in Europe for the next 10 to 20 years shouldn\t worry anyone too much. What most scientists agree on is that more people have felt the shifting and bursting of the Earth\s crust in recent weeks than is usually the case thus causing more attention. As many as 30000 lives have been lost in quakes this year three times higher than the average. The agency lists 67000 deaths from quakes in Peru and Turkey in 1970. Earthquake Deaths According to the US. Geological Survey the toll this year includes 23000 killed in Guatemala Feb 4 G00 deaths in northeastern Italy May 6 600 deaths in Bali Indonesia July 14 and more than 3750 in the Philippines last week. Not included are victims of China\s July 27-28 and the Soviet Union\s April 8 and May 1 major quakes. There also has been no confirmation of accounts of 9000 killed in western New Guinea after a June 25 quake in the so-called ‘‘ring of fire’ which has the highest level of volcanic and quake activity. The survey said there have been 37 ‘significant’ earthquakes registering 6.5 or stronger on the open-ended Richter scale in 1976. Of that number 10 were labeled “major” quakes measuring 7.0 to 7.9 and three were ‘great’ earthquakes of 8 to 8.9 The long-term is about 16 to 18 major earthquakes one great quake a year. A survey official said the number of major and great quakes reported this year has doubled since June but not enough is known to determine whether the changing pace in worldwide earthquake activity is significant. Prof. Markus Baath head of Sweden\s Uppsala Seismological Institute said ‘the quakes so far this year are not above the long-term average. What has happened is that the tremors have struck highly populated areas and the death tolls are higher than usual.” Baath said the movement is one of what scientists call ‘tectonic plates’’ — there are about a half-dozen of them covering the Earth\s surface — may create a release of tension an earthquake in another distant area. Prof. Romolo Romano of the International Institute of Volcanology in Catania Sicily at the foot of Mt. Etna. goes further “It... seems certain’’ he said “that the earthquake in the Philippines and the volcanic eruption in Guadeloupe (in the Caribbean) are phenomena connected with the recent earthquakes in China.’. Shigeji Suyehiro chief of Japan\s Meteorological Agency earthquake section. and Wellington Minosa chief of the Philippines’ Geophysical and Astronomical Service disagreed. They said they do not think there is any relation between the quakes in China and the Philippines. |

Materialism is as bad in the hippie movement as it is elsewhere. “The hippie talks about love but he doesn’t mean it or practice it in the Biblical sense. It is mostly sex—in fact sex worship.” The Lockways said Jim were hippies ‘‘the full route.” He had long hair and a beard. They used the hippie drugs wore the hippie love beads and dressed in hippie attire. Last year they decided to drop out of the hippie world. Kicking drugs was toughest. Lockway 25 says he used LSD and methedrine which hippies call “‘speed.’”’ Nia 20 says she smoked marijuana. Both quit. They cut their hair Nia stopped wearing yellow-tinted glasses with gold rims. Lockway traded his jersey with barber-pole stripes for a white shirt and tie. He quit drawing advertisements for an underground newspaper “and put his talents to work for an architect. And he started a window washing business on the side. Lockway told Hubbard Keavy of the Laguna Beach News-Post in an interview that he was a hippie after graduating high school in 1962 “because there was so much lack of concern by others for young people.” |

| It’S Not Just For Cops Anymore — How This Tiny Body Cam Lets Anyone Record Everything | It’S Getting So Thugs Cant Get Any Privacy Police Say |

| Kurt Knutsson, Cyberguy Report for the Fox News | News Wire Article published in the Ogden Standard Examiner |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Body cameras are usually associated with law enforcement but what if you could have one for yourself? Imagine being able to capture everything that happens around you and send a distress signal to your family or friends if you need help. That’s what PhoneCam a tiny affordable and smart AI-powered device can do for you. ...<br><br>Read the full article <b>[here](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/its-not-just-for-cops-anymore-how-this-tiny-body-cam-lets-anyone-record-everything)</b>. | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon perhaps crooks wont have any privacy and but few secrets from the law. The cops have a couple of new gadgets they say hear all and tell all—to the cops. The devices have a few citizens worried. Burglars detest being disturbed at work. Both inventions have sort of put suburban Highland Park police and robbers on an old-fashioned telephone party line with the crooks doing most of the talking. Highland Park police claim the devices are good for detecting crimes being committed behind closed doors and thick walls. All detectives need to do with one of the machines is press it against the wall and listen. It picks up all noises inside like a physician’s stethoscope. The other is a miniature radio broadcasting set worn by undercover agents who drop in on poker games or horserace bookmakers. A microphone concealed in the agent’s lapel radios all conversations to officers listening to an automobile receiving set. The inside operative flips a button when he is ready for the pinch and presto! the raiding cops descend. The raiding officers thus may testify in court as witnesses to words spoken before they arrived explained Police Chief Millard Gardner. Ray Hollifield Highland Park police radio engineer formerly a technician in the Edison laboratories perfected the tricky listening machine after coming here. It was being worked on at the time he was in the laboratories. It has been used to capture five whisky stills concealed in buildings. It found concealed water pipes in the police station walls and located an outboard motor on the bottom of a lake. The thing is practically all ears. Because some people might use it for other purposes Hollifield said he hoped to limit its use to policemen. He is keeping its mechanism secret. From now on he said crooks will have about as much privacy as a pet canary. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cody Brundage had a gut feeling his next fight would be against Bo Nickal at UFC 300 so when the offer officially came through he was all about it. Nickal (5-0 MMA 2-0 UFC) is arguably the most highly touted prospect in all of MMA. The former three-time NCAA Division I national wrestling champion has had high expectations placed on him since his professional debut less than three years ago and so far he’s delivered by finishing every opponent including four in 62 seconds or less.

Only a long walk in Central Park and a rubdown are on the card for tomorrow the fighter having reached the peak of condition and his fighting weight of 192 pounds. Trained down to a fine edge Sharkey found it harder than ever to pull his punches today and he uncorked some rights and lefts in sparring which drew words of caution from his corner. Sharkey continued as a favorite in the betting. Wagers were reported at odds ranging from six to five to 13 to 10 on Sharkey to win. The bulk of Dempsey money was placed at longer odds about 1 to 3 on the chance of a knockout victory for the former champion. |
