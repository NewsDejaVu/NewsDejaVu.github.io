| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOHELA’s haphazard handling of the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which encourages college graduates to enter fields serving the public good with the promise of having their student debt canceled after a certain period. People have complained of inaccurate payment counts, inconsistent information, long wait times and processing delays, problems they say undermine the program.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSLF program was created by Congress in 2007, and requires borrowers to make 120 on-time monthly payments for 10 years to have their remaining balance canceled. They must work for the government or certain nonprofit organizations and be enrolled in specific repayment plans.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program has long been derided by participants, lawmakers and consumer groups for being exceedingly complex and poorly managed, leading the Biden administration in 2021 to temporarily relax the rules and then ultimately rewrite them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a lawsuit filed Monday, plaintiffs Jennifer Joy and Misty Thomas say some of the  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/12/12/mohela-lawsuit-public-service-loan-forgiveness/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/12/12/mohela-lawsuit-public-service-loan-forgiveness/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: Washington, Feb. 28.—(U. P.)— With more than 1,000 checks issued to World War veterans wethin two hours after cougress made the veter an’s loan bill a law by overriding President Hoover's veto, Veterans Bureau workers were prepared to-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day for another rush at the local regional office.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many in the small army of form- er soldiers assembled at the bureau were from out of the city, apparent- ly unaware they could effect their loans more easily at their regional offices. The bureau here also has re- ceived a flood of applications by mail<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Hoover and veterans affairs administrator Hines have an- nounced that the needy veterans will be given priority in administer- ing the law. An appeal to veterans to assist in giving priority to the needy was made by Hines in a radio talk last ngiht.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hines also cautioned that veterans take care in not jeopardizing the value of their adjusted service cer- tificates, He pointed to figures show ing that if the full 50 per cent loan value is exercised and the interest is not paid annually, only a small amount would remain at maturity due to the 4 1-2 per cent compound- ed interest rate,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first loan was made five min- ules after the Senate voted, 76 to 17 yesterday to override the President's veto. A check for $431.50 was dis- patched to a Baltimore veteran who sought the money for an operation for his young son.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bureau has telegraphed a to- tal of $17,500,000 to the 54 regional offices so there will be no delay in handling the rush of applications, An appropriation of $2,000,000 to provide for additiona] personnel and facilities for expediting handling of the loans is contained in the second deficiency bill.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bureau records show that on Jan- uary 31 there were 3,510,818 adjusted service certificates in force, Their average value is estimated at $1,000, The certificates have a loan value only if they have been in force two years or more. Most of the certifi- cates are about five years old, it was said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final enactment of the law came after a dramatic scene in the Senate The high point in the three-hour debate on the veto was when Sena- tor Hastings, Repn., Del., an oppon ent of the measure, said many veter ans would steal their certificates from their wives and spend the mon ey to go out with some other woman<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement brought hisses and cries of ‘No, no”’ from the crowded galleries,  |
