Choose your plan ArrowRight Earlier this month, a Dallas-area woman named Kate Cox, a mother of two who was pregnant with a much-wanted third child, asked courts to grant her an exception to the state’s post-Roe antiabortion legislation because that much-wanted child had been diagnosed with a fatal genetic condition that almost always results in miscarriage or stillbirth.

(AP) —_ Rep- resentatives of the Northeast Kansas “Right to Life’ organization, ap- peared at the statehouse today sup- porting a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would over- turn the recent U.S, Supreme Court decision on abortions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headed by Dr. John Senior, professor of classics at the University of Kansas and a member of the executive board of the Kansas Right to Life group, the representatives held a news conference outside the state Senate chamber.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appearing with them was State Rep. John F.

Dan Bromley, D-Atchison, also would introduce a resolution in the Kansas Senate calling for the legislature’s support of Hogan’s pro- posed amendment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Supreme Court recently held that states can make laws to regulate abortions only in the final three months of pregnancy. Bills have been introduced in this session of the legislature to bring Kansas’ abortion law — liberalized in 1970 — into conformity with the Supreme Court’s<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decision. “The Supreme Court has declared<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that unborn children are non- persons,” Senior declared at the news conference. “This country tried to do the same thing to Negroes in the Dred Scott decision.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The rights contained in the Bill of Rights accrue to children from conception,”’ Senior argued.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked what was to stop the courts from deciding which retarded persons and deformed persons should not live if the high court’s abortion decision is allowed to stand.  |
