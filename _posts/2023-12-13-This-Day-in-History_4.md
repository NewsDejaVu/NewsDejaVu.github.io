| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOHELA’s haphazard handling of the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which encourages college graduates to enter fields serving the public good with the promise of having their student debt canceled after a certain period. People have complained of inaccurate payment counts, inconsistent information, long wait times and processing delays, problems they say undermine the program.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSLF program was created by Congress in 2007, and requires borrowers to make 120 on-time monthly payments for 10 years to have their remaining balance canceled. They must work for the government or certain nonprofit organizations and be enrolled in specific repayment plans.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program has long been derided by participants, lawmakers and consumer groups for being exceedingly complex and poorly managed, leading the Biden administration in 2021 to temporarily relax the rules and then ultimately rewrite them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a lawsuit filed Monday, plaintiffs Jennifer Joy and Misty Thomas say some of the  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/12/12/mohela-lawsuit-public-service-loan-forgiveness/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/12/12/mohela-lawsuit-public-service-loan-forgiveness/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (At -- In New lersay, a class-action suit voided the contracts 24 customers had signed agreeing to pay $280 for home educational kits worth about $40.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For California home buyers, a class-action suit means a chance to earn interest on the tax escrow accounts required by the in- stitutions holding their mortgages.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug companies accused of fixing prices, oil companies accused of levying excessive credit card finance charges and a door-to- door freezer salesman accused of defrauding his customers all have felt the sting of class- action consumer lawsuits.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class action suit, filed under federal and state laws, permits those with a common claim to combine their interests and mount a suit which wouldn't have been worth the ef- fort and legal fees if several separate suits were necessary.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such suits constitute a small but growing proportion of legal cases nationwide.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Class action is becoming more popular, but not necessarily more successful,” said<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark DBudnitz, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of class-action suits pending in federal courts at the end of last year was 3,500. Nearly half of them deal with civil rights, and in total they make up about 3 per cent of all federal civil cases. By comparison 25,000 personal injury cases were pending.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American College of Trial Lawyers studied the Southern District of New York, the single largest adjudicator of federal class- action suits, and found the number filed annually increased nearly four times in five years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases class-action suits have become a victim of their own popularity, producing a mixed pattern of acceptance by courts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five states have approved laws permitting consumer class-action suits, according to the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs. In 13 other states the restrictions on such suits have been eased.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But judges elsewhere have recoiled at the prospect of massive judgments.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue of paying interest on heme mortgage tax escrow accounts, for example, was accepted as a class action in California, where the legislature has approved class- action bills dealing with consumer and en- vironmental issues. A similar case was denied class-action status in the District of Columbia.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal Truth-in-Lending law fines offenders $100 for each instance of inadequate credit information disclosure. When lawyers sued Chemical Bank of New York on behalf of 130,000 charge card holders, the judge called the possible $13 million penalty a “horren- dous, possibly annihilating punishment’ and disallowed it as a class action. The Senate now is considering limiting liability to $50,000 or 1 per cent of a company's net worth for offenses against the lending act<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another class-action case spent seven years bounding back and forth from district to appellate courts. The issue was whether an estimated six million persons could sue jointly to get back as much as $60 million they claimed they had been overcharged on stock<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COM TRISS IONS .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An appeals court finally declared the suit unmanageable as a class action and said: “Class actions have sprouted and multiplied like the leaves of the green bay tree”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beverly C, Moore Jr, co-author of a Ralph Nader report on antitrust enforcement and now a public interest Washington lawyer, said the stock commission ruling means, “We are about to see the end of significant class ac tions.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nathaniel Colley, the California lawyer arguing the rent escrow cases, said the decision “would in effect eliminate the in- tended effect of Rule 23."° But Colley said the decision will not kill class action suits, par ticularly in the states.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials of the Pacific Legal Foundation, an arm of the Califorma State Chamber of Commerce, have complamed the states class-action laws have led to harassment of business and the government. “I think California is going to start to tighten up its liberal approach to class action,” said at torney Ronald A.
