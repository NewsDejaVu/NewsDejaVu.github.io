| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel faces an agonizing and probably controversial dilemma ahead: After pausing the Gaza war for humanitarian reasons, how will the Israel Defense Forces start it up again to complete its objective of destroying Hamas’s political power?

ArrowRight Friday’s celebrations of the release of 13 Israeli women and children didn’t mask the concern among senior Israeli officials about what’s ahead in this stop-start war as Israel seeks to recover all 240 hostages and also crush the Hamas forces that hold most of them. “It’s bittersweet,” said one senior Israeli official in an interview on the eve of the hostage release. “I’m thinking of those who will not come out tomorrow.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel hopes this round of trading hostages for Palestinian women and teenage prisoners can be extended until all the roughly 100 women and children held in Gaza have been freed. “At this point in time, Israel is focu ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/25/israel-gaza-war-hamas-ceasefire-next-phase/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/25/israel-gaza-war-hamas-ceasefire-next-phase/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON — Iranian authori- ties were reported by high-ranking ad- ministration officials Friday to be con- sidering releasing many, but not all, of the 52 American hostages pending final resolution of the nearly yearlong dispute with the United States.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officials said the reported Ira- nian plan is under discussion in Tehran but has not been proposed to Washington. The plan, however, has been learned from other diplomats in contact with Iranian officials in Tehran, they said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iranian Parliament is sched- uled to receive a report on Sunday from a special seven-man commission set up to devise conditions for freeing the hostages. The idea for the initial release of as many as 40 hostages is presumed to be one of the proposals being discussed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possibility of a partial release is reportedly known to only a few American officials, and in the last few days they have been discussing how to react if that happens.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the presidential election only 10 days away, a partial release would place President Carter in a political<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bind if the Iranians tried to hold the other hostages for a trial or for a pro- longed period while their demands were being acted upon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials were reported to have told the Iranians that they want all the hos- tages freed at once as part of an ar- rangement to resolve the crisis. A par- tial release would raise new questions about whether the remaining hostages were still alive, officials said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the day, the Carter ad- ministration worked lo dampen specu- lation on an imminent release.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NBC News quoted a Moslem source al the United Nations as saying that the release would begin Sunday, barring unforeseen developments.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NBC's report cited “a reliable and high-ranking Moslem diplomat” at the United Nations. The network said its source had talked Thursday night with the Iranian prime minister and the speaker of Iran’s parliament and they told him that barring unforeseen cir- cumstances, the hostage release would begin Sunday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A State Department spokesman, John Trattner, said of the NBC report: “We have no information from any source whatsoever about any Iranian plans, including this report.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An official of a foreign corporation that does business in Tehran said the hostages were being reassembled in preparation for a possible release. It could not be confirmed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter, asked about the NBC re- port after landing in Grand Rapids, Mich., where he was campaigning, said: “I wouldn't count on it.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a campaign appearance Friday night in Wyoming, Mich., Carter said “We don’t have any clear signal” from Iran regarding terms for release of the hostages. Karlier, campaigning in New Jersey, he cautioned against undue optimism about an early re- lease for them.  |
