| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Biden will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House this week, the administration announced Sunday, as Congress looks increasingly unlikely to pass additional funding for Ukraine and as U.S. officials warn that the country will run out of money by the end of the year to fight against Russia’s invasion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zelensky also will meet with some congressional leaders on Tuesday. Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) invited Zelensky to speak to senators Tuesday morning, according to a Senate leadership aide. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) will also meet with Zelensky, spokesman Raj Shah said on X, formerly Twitter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biden will host Zelensky on Tuesday “to underscore the United States’ unshakable commitment to supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia’s brutal invasion,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. “As Russia ramps up its missile and drone  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/10/biden-invites-zelensky-washington-amid-ukraine-funding-fight/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/10/biden-invites-zelensky-washington-amid-ukraine-funding-fight/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi- dent Nixon and an expanded panel of congressional Republi- can leaders concentrated for more than an hour today at the White House on the Senate dis- pute over legislation to cut off appropriations for American op- erations in Cambodia. They ‘came to no decision on a course of action.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate GOP leader, Hugh Scott of. .Rerinsylvania, said there was a general discussion of various amendments, center- ing on the proposal by Sens. John Sherman Cooper, R-Ky., and Frank Church, D-Idaho. ‘The search continues for an acceptable solution,” Scott said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cooper-Church amend- ment, under fire from the White House as a restriction on presi- dential options and powers, would require pulling USS. troops out of Cambodia by June 30 and bar additional American<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strikes into the country. It would allow air cover for South Vietnamese troops fighting North Vietnamese in Cambodia but no American military action in support of the Cambodian government,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White House press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler repeated the White House stand against the Cooper-Church formula and said, too, that the White House has not endorsed any alterna- tive amendments. But he did not absolutely bar some modi- fied proposal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White House meeting brought out -17 people—six sena- tors, nine House members, Sec- retary of State William P, Rog- ers and Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird. The two Cabi- net members briefed the Capitol Hill contingent, Ziegler report-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ed. Laird told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Monday<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that small numbers of U.S. troops have made brief sorties into Laos and might repeat them. But he said there would be no large-scale American mil- itary operations there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield told reporters at the Capitol that in his view, Laotian incursions violate “at least the spirit” of a congres- sional ban against spending to put ground combat troops into either Laos or Thailand...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mansfield said he does not know what Congress will do about it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Give us a little time,” he said. “We just found out about this.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said meanwhile Nixon’s decision to enter Cambodia was “‘the lat- est example of presidential usurpation of congressional war powers which has been going on for at least 20 years.”  |
