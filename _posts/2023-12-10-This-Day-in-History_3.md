The offi- —Cial attitude of the government is that while it reluctantly sup- ports the United States it feels a military solution is impossible and the war must be settled at the conference table,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— The Belgian government gave nine scholarships to the South Vietnamese this year and the Belgian-American Associa- tion gave an ambulance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Turkey has been officially quiet about Vietnam but behind the scenes has sympathized with Washington. Turkey has made no contribution to the U.S. effort, however.  |
