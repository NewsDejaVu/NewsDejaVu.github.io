| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word “narrative” often dominates descriptions of politics, and right now the narrative about the competition to become Donald Trump’s principal rival for the Republican presidential nomination appears set: Nikki Haley is on a booster rocket and Ron DeSantis is on the brink of collapse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality seems more nuanced.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There’s no question that DeSantis has been a major disappointment to his boosters and the coverage of his campaign from the start has been tough and critical, aided by the Florida governor’s sometimes rocky performance as a candidate. He’s slid in the polls since entering the race as the clear No. 2, and has been the favorite target of the former president, who has mocked him mercilessly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DeSantis underperformed early expectations, which were probably inflated given Trump’s dominance over the Republican Party. He stumbled at times, particularly in the early months when he lacked a clear focus for his candidacy. He has been demeaned for not having a winning personality.  ...<br><br>Read the full article at<br>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/12/09/haley-desantis-trump-iowa-caucus/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/12/09/haley-desantis-trump-iowa-caucus/) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By ARNOLD B, SAWISLAK<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (UPI)—Just as stock market speculators try to buy early into companies with good business prospects, Republican politicians who don’t want to be left behind are starting toward the presidential candidacy of Richard M, Nixon,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement to date is no stamped, but it can be seen, It seems to be impelled by the expectation that the former vice president will beat his only formal rival for the Republican nomination, Gov. George W, Romney of Michigan, in New Hampshire March 12 and build up strong momentum for the primaries to follow,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main indication that Nixon’s candidacy is beginning<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to roll comes from talk. Conversation was the main acvitity of the GOP National Committee members and state chairmen who met here last week, and much of it centered on a belief that Nixon will get the nomination next August in Miami Beach, Some of this came from Eastern Republicans jeast favorable to Nixon,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the feeling of the politicians is based on a New Hampshire victory, and if Nixon doesn’t get it, the outlook obviously would change, Nixon himself has said it would be “fatal? to lose both New Hampshire next month and the Wisconsin primary April 2, Since Nixon has said he expects to win solidly in both, his<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comments are plainly aimed dt Romney. But because Nixon ts the candidate who is trying to arase the “loser”? image pinned on him by the presidential loss in 1960 and his 1962 failure to win the California governorship, the assessment would have to apply to himself as well,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anticipation of a New Hampshire win for Nixon is not the only development pointing toward a rise in his prospects,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early last week, the Gallup Poll showed Nixon as the choice of 51 per cent of Republicans and 34 per cent of independents for the GOP presidential nomination, This was a rise of 9 per cent among Republicans, 7 per cent among independents,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cont'd on Page 2)  |
