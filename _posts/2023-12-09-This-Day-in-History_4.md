The Senate lineup is 48 Re publicans, 47 Democrats and one Independent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truman had hoped to attend the Democratic rally here launching the Democratic drive to regal ‘control of Congress. But he stil is recuperating from a June opera tion and will make only one majo! campaign speech, at Kansas Cit) Oct. 16.  |
